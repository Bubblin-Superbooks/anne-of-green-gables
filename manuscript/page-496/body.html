And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now, you mustn&rsquo;t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower garden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I want to see it, for I&rsquo;m very much interested in flowers.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
