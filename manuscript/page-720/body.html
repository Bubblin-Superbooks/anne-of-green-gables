<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You old darling, it&rsquo;s perfectly splendid to see you back again. It seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get along?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don&rsquo;t know whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment that I didn&rsquo;t. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the dearest, loveliest spot in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did the others do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The girls say they know they didn&rsquo;t pass, but I think they did pretty well. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it! Moody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he failed in algebra. But we don&rsquo;t really know anything about it and won&rsquo;t until the pass list is out.</p></div> </div>
