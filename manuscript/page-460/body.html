<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I wanted to be extra good today because it&rsquo;s an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t think of anything special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never forget it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t seem so important to you. I&rsquo;ve been here for a year and I&rsquo;ve been so happy. Of course, I&rsquo;ve had my troubles, but one can live down troubles. Are you sorry you kept me, Marilla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, &ldquo;no, not exactly sorry.</p></div> </div>
