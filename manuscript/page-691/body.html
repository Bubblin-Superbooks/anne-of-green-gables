She and Diana fairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that Lover&rsquo;s Lane and the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded. Marilla offered no objections to Anne&rsquo;s gypsyings. The Spencervale doctor who had come the night Minnie May had the croup met Anne at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her over sharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head, and sent a message to Marilla Cuthbert by another person.
