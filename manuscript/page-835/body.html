<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But I can have the Carmody school&mdash;Mr. Blair told me so last night at the store. Of course that won&rsquo;t be quite as nice or convenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and drive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And even in winter I can come home Fridays. We&rsquo;ll keep a horse for that. Oh, I have it all planned out, Marilla. And I&rsquo;ll read to you and keep you cheered up. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be dull or lonesome. And we&rsquo;ll be real cozy and happy here together, you and I.&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream.</p></div> </div>
