It isn&rsquo;t as if birthdays were common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite &lsquo;Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight.&rsquo; That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, I&rsquo;m sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns. And oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is; he&rsquo;s going to give an address. That will be just about the same thing as a sermon. Please, mayn&rsquo;t I go, Marilla?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
