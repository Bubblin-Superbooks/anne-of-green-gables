Never in all her life had Marilla seen anything so grotesque as Anne&rsquo;s hair at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s green,&rdquo; moaned Anne. &ldquo;I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair. But now I know it&rsquo;s ten times worse to have green hair. Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;Come right down to the kitchen&mdash;it&rsquo;s too cold up here&mdash;and tell me just what you&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;ve been expecting something queer for some time.</p></div> </div>
