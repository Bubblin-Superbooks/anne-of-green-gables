The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty I thought they&rsquo;d look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be a dreadful trial to you. Maybe you&rsquo;d better send me back to the asylum. That would be terrible; I don&rsquo;t think I could endure it; most likely I would go into consumption; I&rsquo;m so thin as it is, you see. But that would be better than being a trial to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child cry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to send you back to the asylum, I&rsquo;m sure.</p></div> </div>
