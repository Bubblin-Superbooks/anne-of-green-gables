You find out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came to see me, and he&rsquo;s really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of course; but still I like him and I&rsquo;m awfully sorry I ever criticized his prayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he didn&rsquo;t. He could get over that if he&rsquo;d take a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem so strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy.</p></div> </div>
