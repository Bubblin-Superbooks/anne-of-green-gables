<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crying,&rdquo; said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why. I&rsquo;m glad as glad can be. Oh, glad doesn&rsquo;t seem the right word at all. I was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms&mdash;but this! Oh, it&rsquo;s something more than glad. I&rsquo;m so happy. I&rsquo;ll try to be so good. It will be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was desperately wicked. However, I&rsquo;ll do my very best. But can you tell me why I&rsquo;m crying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re all excited and worked up,&rdquo; said Marilla disapprovingly. &ldquo;Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I&rsquo;m afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily.</p></div> </div>
