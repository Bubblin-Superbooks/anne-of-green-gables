Today Diana said something funny and I found myself laughing. I thought when it happened I could never laugh again. And it somehow seems as if I oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Allan gently. &ldquo;He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the same.
