<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the window.</p><p>&ldquo;There&mdash;I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming upstairs. Now I&rsquo;m going to imagine things into this room so that they&rsquo;ll always stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The furniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound so luxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions, pink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it. I can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall. I am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair.</p></div> </div>
