<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody Spurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn&rsquo;t. Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon I&rsquo;m always glad I&rsquo;m a girl and not his sister.</p><p>&ldquo;Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had been with us.</p></div> </div>
