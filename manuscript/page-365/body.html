Diana and I are parted forever. Oh, Marilla, I little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she finds you&rsquo;re not to blame. I suppose she thinks you&rsquo;ve done it for a silly joke or something of that sort. You&rsquo;d best go up this evening and tell her how it was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana&rsquo;s injured mother,&rdquo; sighed Anne. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go, Marilla. You&rsquo;re so much more dignified than I am. Likely she&rsquo;d listen to you quicker than to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
