<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn&rsquo;t it? Mrs. Lynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There were thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully insignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn&rsquo;t go; she said horse racing was an abomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s absence would ever be noticed. I don&rsquo;t think, though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they are awfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win.</p></div> </div>
