<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson ulster. Anne flew down the slope to meet her.</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it&rsquo;s a wonderful Christmas. I&rsquo;ve something splendid to show you. Matthew has given me the loveliest dress, with such sleeves. I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine any nicer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something more for you,&rdquo; said Diana breathlessly. &ldquo;Here&mdash;this box. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it&mdash;and this is for you. I&rsquo;d have brought it over last night, but it didn&rsquo;t come until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
