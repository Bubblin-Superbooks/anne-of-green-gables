She&rsquo;s been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I&rsquo;ve heard such exciting things about the new teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else&rsquo;s in Avonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it&rsquo;s just glorious to think of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie has so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are preparing a dialogue, called &lsquo;A Morning Visit,&rsquo; for next Friday.</p></div> </div>
