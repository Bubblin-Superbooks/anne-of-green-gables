When I try to imagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just as he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it&rsquo;s so easy to imagine Mrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen times. Isn&rsquo;t that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister&rsquo;s wife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to have visit you, too. She never tells you it&rsquo;s your own fault and she hopes you&rsquo;ll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told me that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope I&rsquo;d be a better girl but didn&rsquo;t really believe I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole.</p></div> </div>
