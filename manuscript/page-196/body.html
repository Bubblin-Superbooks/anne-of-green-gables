Anne! Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t any right to call me ugly and redheaded,&rdquo; retorted Anne, evasive and defiant.</p><p>&ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her, Anne. I was ashamed of you&mdash;thoroughly ashamed of you. I wanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have disgraced me. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You say it yourself often enough.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
