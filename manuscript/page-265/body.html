<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You must come and see it, Marilla&mdash;won&rsquo;t you? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on them. Of course, they&rsquo;re all broken but it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole. There&rsquo;s a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind their chicken house. It&rsquo;s all full of rainbows&mdash;just little young rainbows that haven&rsquo;t grown big yet&mdash;and Diana&rsquo;s mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had. But it&rsquo;s nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass. Matthew is going to make us a table.</p></div> </div>
