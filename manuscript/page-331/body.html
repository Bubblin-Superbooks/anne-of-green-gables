I&rsquo;ve been insulted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Insulted fiddlesticks! You&rsquo;ll go to school tomorrow as usual.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; Anne shook her head gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll learn my lessons at home and I&rsquo;ll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it&rsquo;s possible at all. But I will not go back to school, I assure you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
