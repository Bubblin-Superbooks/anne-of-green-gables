<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You can make a layer cake,&rdquo; promised Marilla.</p><p>Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables. Having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red stones by the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I&rsquo;m to make in the morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just before teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy two days of it. It&rsquo;s such a responsibility having a minister&rsquo;s family to tea. I never went through such an experience before.</p></div> </div>
