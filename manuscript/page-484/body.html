<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You should just see our pantry. It&rsquo;s a sight to behold. We&rsquo;re going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue. We&rsquo;re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies, and fruit cake, and Marilla&rsquo;s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister is dyspeptic and can&rsquo;t eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic, but I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn&rsquo;t be good! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
