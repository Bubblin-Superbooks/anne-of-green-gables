But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it would be tragic, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and not to miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well&mdash;such a romantic spot. Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he wouldn&rsquo;t take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very fashionable to dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews and I heard him to say &lsquo;sweets to the sweet.&rsquo; He got that out of a book, I know; but it shows he has some imagination.</p></div> </div>
