I felt as if a million eyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I was sure I couldn&rsquo;t begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away. I just felt like a parrot.</p></div> </div>
