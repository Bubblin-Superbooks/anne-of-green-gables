Now?&rdquo; asked Marilla, when Anne had just come in from a run to the post office. &ldquo;Have you discovered another kindred spirit?&rdquo; Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature. She had come dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office. Just look at it, Marilla. &lsquo;Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.&rsquo; That is the first time I was ever called &lsquo;Miss.&rsquo; Such a thrill as it gave me! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
