<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;ve held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn&rsquo;t want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she&rsquo;s an old maid. But that&rsquo;s always the way. Folks that has brought up children know that there&rsquo;s no hard and fast method in the world that&rsquo;ll suit every child. But them as never have think it&rsquo;s all as plain and easy as Rule of Three&mdash;just set your three terms down so fashion, and the sum &lsquo;ll work out correct. But flesh and blood don&rsquo;t come under the head of arithmetic and that&rsquo;s where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake. I suppose she&rsquo;s trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as she does; but it&rsquo;s more likely to cultivate envy and discontent. I&rsquo;m sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls&rsquo;.</p></div> </div>
