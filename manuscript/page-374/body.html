Why, Diana, I didn&rsquo;t think anybody could love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is wonderful! It&rsquo;s a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you devotedly, Anne,&rdquo; said Diana stanchly, &ldquo;and I always will, you may be sure of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I will always love thee, Diana,&rdquo; said Anne, solemnly extending her hand. &ldquo;In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
