<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser. &ldquo;I knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it&rsquo;s made a nice lot of trouble, that&rsquo;s what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but she declares she won&rsquo;t stay another day and is going right back to town tomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She&rsquo;d have gone today if they could have taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter&rsquo;s music lessons for Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The Barrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they&rsquo;d like to keep on the good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn&rsquo;t say just that to me, but I&rsquo;m a pretty good judge of human nature, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
