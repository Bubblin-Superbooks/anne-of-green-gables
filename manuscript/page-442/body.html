Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the worst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up. She says she won&rsquo;t stay and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care. But Father and Mother do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell them it was my fault?&rdquo; demanded Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;d do such a thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Diana with just scorn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame as you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
