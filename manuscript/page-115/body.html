<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother&rsquo;s name was Bertha Shirley. Aren&rsquo;t Walter and Bertha lovely names? I&rsquo;m so glad my parents had nice names. It would be a real disgrace to have a father named&mdash;well, say Jedediah, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter what a person&rsquo;s name is as long as he behaves himself,&rdquo; said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Anne looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to believe it. I don&rsquo;t believe a rose would be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.
