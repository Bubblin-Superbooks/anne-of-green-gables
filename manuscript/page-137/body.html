<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that Matthew and I had absolutely decided that we wouldn&rsquo;t keep her. In fact I may say that Matthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred. I think I&rsquo;d better take her home again and talk it over with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn&rsquo;t to decide on anything without consulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we&rsquo;ll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night. If we don&rsquo;t you may know that she is going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
