<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; confessed Anne. &ldquo;Diana and I just imagined the wood was haunted. All the places around here are so&mdash;so&mdash;commonplace. We just got this up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it&rsquo;s so gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There&rsquo;s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand&mdash;so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And there&rsquo;s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs.</p></div> </div>
