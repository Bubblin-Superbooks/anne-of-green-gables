Matthew took a fancy to her. And I must say I like her myself&mdash;although I admit she has her faults. The house seems a different place already.

You don&rsquo;t know much about her or her real disposition, I suppose, and there&rsquo;s no guessing how a child like that will turn out. But I don&rsquo;t want to discourage you I&rsquo;m sure, Marilla.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
