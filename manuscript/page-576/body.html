<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it&rsquo;s proper to talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties. I&rsquo;m striving very hard to overcome it and now that I&rsquo;m really thirteen perhaps I&rsquo;ll get on better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In four more years we&rsquo;ll be able to put our hair up,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think that&rsquo;s ridiculous. I shall wait until I&rsquo;m seventeen.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
