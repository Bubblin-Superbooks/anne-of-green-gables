<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;If I had Alice Bell&rsquo;s crooked nose,&rdquo; said Anne decidedly, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;but there! I won&rsquo;t say what I was going to because it was extremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and that&rsquo;s vanity. I&rsquo;m afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to me. Oh, Diana, look, there&rsquo;s a rabbit. That&rsquo;s something to remember for our woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer. They&rsquo;re so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
