Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his tea in his corner. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never thinking once about the time or her duties. She&rsquo;s just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing. I don&rsquo;t care if Mrs. Allan does say she&rsquo;s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. She may be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there&rsquo;s never any knowing what shape it&rsquo;ll break out in next. Just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another. But there! Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today.</p></div> </div>
