I wanted to go, but Marilla said I&rsquo;d be better at home learning my lessons and so would Jane. I was bitterly disappointed, Diana. I felt so heartbroken that I wouldn&rsquo;t say my prayers when I went to bed.

She&rsquo;ll be more likely to let you go then; and if she does we&rsquo;ll have the time of our lives, Anne. I&rsquo;ve never been to an Exhibition, and it&rsquo;s so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips. Jane and Ruby have been twice, and they&rsquo;re going this year again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
