<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ON the Monday evening before the picnic Marilla came down from her room with a troubled face.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing, &ldquo;Nelly of the Hazel Dell&rdquo; with a vigor and expression that did credit to Diana&rsquo;s teaching, &ldquo;did you see anything of my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening, but I can&rsquo;t find it anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,&rdquo; said Anne, a little slowly. &ldquo;I was passing your door when I saw it on the cushion, so I went in to look at it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
