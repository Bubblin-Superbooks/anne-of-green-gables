It&rsquo;s very wrong in a little girl to meddle. You shouldn&rsquo;t have gone into my room in the first place and you shouldn&rsquo;t have touched a brooch that didn&rsquo;t belong to you in the second. Where did you put it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn&rsquo;t it on a minute. Truly, I didn&rsquo;t mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn&rsquo;t think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I&rsquo;ll never do it again. That&rsquo;s one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty thing twice.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
