You&rsquo;ve taken it out or something, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did put it back,&rdquo; said Anne quickly&mdash;pertly, Marilla thought. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray. But I&rsquo;m perfectly certain I put it back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and have another look,&rdquo; said Marilla, determining to be just. &ldquo;If you put that brooch back it&rsquo;s there still.
