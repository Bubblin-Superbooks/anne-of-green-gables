<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No boys were allowed in it&mdash;although Ruby Gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting&mdash;and each member had to produce one story a week.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely interesting,&rdquo; Anne told Marilla. &ldquo;Each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over. We are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write under a nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency. All the girls do pretty well. Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little. Jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud. Jane&rsquo;s stories are extremely sensible. Then Diana puts too many murders into hers.</p></div> </div>
