We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So many flashes mean a certain thing. It was my idea, Marilla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you it was,&rdquo; said Marilla emphatically. &ldquo;And the next thing you&rsquo;ll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re very careful, Marilla. And it&rsquo;s so interesting. Two flashes mean, &lsquo;Are you there?&rsquo; Three mean &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and four &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Five mean, &lsquo;Come over as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.&rsquo; Diana has just signaled five flashes, and I&rsquo;m really suffering to know what it is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
