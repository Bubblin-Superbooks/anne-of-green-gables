<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;ve asked my advice, Marilla,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde amiably&mdash;Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just humor her a little at first, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do. It&rsquo;s my belief that Mr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t do to say so to the children, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne, that&rsquo;s what. And I don&rsquo;t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It isn&rsquo;t modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne&rsquo;s part right through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular among them, somehow. I never thought she&rsquo;d take with them so well.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
