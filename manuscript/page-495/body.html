<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; sobbed Anne, without looking up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgraced forever. I shall never be able to live this down. It will get out&mdash;things always do get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I shall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil&mdash;the boys in school will never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark of Christian pity don&rsquo;t tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes after this. I&rsquo;ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but I cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll think I tried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn&rsquo;t poisonous. It&rsquo;s meant to be taken internally&mdash;although not in cakes. Won&rsquo;t you tell Mrs. Allan so, Marilla?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
