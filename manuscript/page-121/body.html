They didn&rsquo;t want me at the asylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had to take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you ever go to school?&rdquo; demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel mare down the shore road.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a great deal. I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs. Thomas. When I went up river we were so far from a school that I couldn&rsquo;t walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so I could only go in the spring and fall. But of course I went while I was at the asylum.</p></div> </div>
