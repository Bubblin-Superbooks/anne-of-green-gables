I wouldn&rsquo;t have dyed it green.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mean to dye it green, Marilla,&rdquo; protested Anne dejectedly. &ldquo;If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black&mdash;he positively assured me that it would. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they&rsquo;re not. I have proof now&mdash;green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I hadn&rsquo;t then and I believed every word he said implicitly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
