It would be terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Anne laughed merrily. &ldquo;There is no sacrifice. Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables&mdash;nothing could hurt me more. We must keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I&rsquo;m not going to Redmond; and I am going to stay here and teach. Don&rsquo;t you worry about me a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But your ambitions&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as ambitious as ever. Only, I&rsquo;ve changed the object of my ambitions. I&rsquo;m going to be a good teacher&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to save your eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself.</p></div> </div>
