<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Yes, you can stay here and we will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it&rsquo;s only a fortnight till vacation so it isn&rsquo;t worth while for you to start before it opens again in September.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to call you?&rdquo; asked Anne. &ldquo;Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert? Can I call you Aunt Marilla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; you&rsquo;ll call me just plain Marilla. I&rsquo;m not used to being called Miss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,&rdquo; protested Anne.</p></div> </div>
