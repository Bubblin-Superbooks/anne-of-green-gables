Well, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her. And her cousins are coming over from Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the hall tomorrow night. And they are going to take Diana and me to the concert&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll let me go, that is. You will, won&rsquo;t you, Marilla? Oh, I feel so excited.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
