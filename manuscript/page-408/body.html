I can tell by the look of you that you&rsquo;re just full up with speeches, but they&rsquo;ll keep.&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then for she knew if she did Anne&rsquo;s consequent excitement would lift her clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner. Not until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I wouldn&rsquo;t wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May&rsquo;s life, and she is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She says she knows now you didn&rsquo;t mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes you&rsquo;ll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again.</p></div> </div>
