Mrs. Lynde isn&rsquo;t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but there&rsquo;s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the Queen&rsquo;s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won&rsquo;t pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings.</p></div> </div>
