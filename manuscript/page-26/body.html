<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, Marilla, I&rsquo;ll just tell you plain that I think you&rsquo;re doing a mighty foolish thing&mdash;a risky thing, that&rsquo;s what. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re getting. You&rsquo;re bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don&rsquo;t know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he&rsquo;s likely to turn out. Why, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night&mdash;set it on purpose, Marilla&mdash;and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t break him of it.</p></div> </div>
