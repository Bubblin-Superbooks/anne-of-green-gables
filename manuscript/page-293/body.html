<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley,&rdquo; said Marilla solemnly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, you said you&rsquo;d keep me here until I confessed,&rdquo; returned Anne wearily, &ldquo;and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I wouldn&rsquo;t forget it. But you wouldn&rsquo;t let me go to the picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
