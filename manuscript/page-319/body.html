<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;Anne, go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white, set face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control her temper,&rdquo; and then read it out loud so that even the primer class, who couldn&rsquo;t read writing, should understand it.</p><p>Anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her. She did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation.</p></div> </div>
