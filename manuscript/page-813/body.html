<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to the east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:</p><p>&ldquo;Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Diana.&rdquo; Anne looked earnestly into her friend&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I think you won&rsquo;t misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I&rsquo;m not afraid. I haven&rsquo;t been alone one minute since it happened&mdash;and I want to be. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can&rsquo;t realize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can&rsquo;t be dead; and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and I&rsquo;ve had this horrible dull ache ever since.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
