<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won&rsquo;t you tell me if you are going to send me away or not? I&rsquo;ve tried to be patient all the morning, but I really feel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It&rsquo;s a dreadful feeling. Please tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to do,&rdquo; said Marilla immovably. &ldquo;Just go and do it before you ask any more questions, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla and fastened imploring eyes of the latter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marilla, unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, &ldquo;I suppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep you&mdash;that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
