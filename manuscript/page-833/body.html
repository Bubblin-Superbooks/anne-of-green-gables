<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Buy it! Buy Green Gables?&rdquo; Anne wondered if she had heard aright. &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, you don&rsquo;t mean to sell Green Gables!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, I don&rsquo;t know what else is to be done. I&rsquo;ve thought it all over. If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can&rsquo;t. I may lose my sight altogether; and anyway I&rsquo;ll not be fit to run things. Oh, I never thought I&rsquo;d live to see the day when I&rsquo;d have to sell my home. But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank; and there&rsquo;s some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere&mdash;with her I suppose. It won&rsquo;t bring much&mdash;it&rsquo;s small and the buildings are old.</p></div> </div>
