No, it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make that seem real.&rdquo;</p><p>She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only Anne of Green Gables,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;and I see you, just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I&rsquo;m the Lady Cordelia. But it&rsquo;s a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
