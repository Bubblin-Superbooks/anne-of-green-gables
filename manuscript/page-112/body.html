<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>DO you know,&rdquo; said Anne confidentially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to enjoy this drive. It&rsquo;s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will. Of course, you must make it up firmly. I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we&rsquo;re having our drive. I&rsquo;m just going to think about the drive. Oh, look, there&rsquo;s one little early wild rose out! Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? Don&rsquo;t you think it must be glad to be a rose? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if roses could talk? I&rsquo;m sure they could tell us such lovely things. And isn&rsquo;t pink the most bewitching color in the world? I love it, but I can&rsquo;t wear it. Redheaded people can&rsquo;t wear pink, not even in imagination.</p></div> </div>
