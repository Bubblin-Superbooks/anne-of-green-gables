<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I never would have thought she&rsquo;d have turned out so well that first day I was here three years ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel. &ldquo;Lawful heart, shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I says to Thomas, says I, &lsquo;Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert &lsquo;ll live to rue the step she&rsquo;s took.&rsquo; But I was mistaken and I&rsquo;m real glad of it. I ain&rsquo;t one of those kind of people, Marilla, as can never be brought to own up that they&rsquo;ve made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank goodness. I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren&rsquo;t no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that&rsquo;s what. There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children. It&rsquo;s nothing short of wonderful how she&rsquo;s improved these three years, but especially in looks.</p></div> </div>
