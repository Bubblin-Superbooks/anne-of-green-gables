That is I wouldn&rsquo;t say school to her again until she said it herself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she&rsquo;ll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord, that&rsquo;s what, while, if you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum she&rsquo;d take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the better, in my opinion. She won&rsquo;t miss much by not going to school, as far as that goes. Mr. Phillips isn&rsquo;t any good at all as a teacher. The order he keeps is scandalous, that&rsquo;s what, and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he&rsquo;s getting ready for Queen&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
