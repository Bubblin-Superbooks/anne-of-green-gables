Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane, so Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it a bit. It was horrid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley!&rdquo; said Marilla rebukingly.</p><p>Anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny&rsquo;s leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.</p><p>&ldquo;They might have been lonesome while I was away,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And now about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs. Lynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with a lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer.</p></div> </div>
