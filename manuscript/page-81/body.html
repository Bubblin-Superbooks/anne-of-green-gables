<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s tired,&rdquo; said Matthew, who hadn&rsquo;t spoken since his return from the barn. &ldquo;Best put her to bed, Marilla.&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed. She had prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy. But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable room. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne spiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as she passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.</p></div> </div>
