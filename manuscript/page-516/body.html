Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house&mdash;except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics&mdash;they found Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, are you killed?&rdquo; shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees beside her friend. &ldquo;Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and tell me if you&rsquo;re killed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
