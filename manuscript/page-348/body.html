Diana had much to tell Anne of what went on in school. She had to sit with Gertie Pye and she hated it; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her&mdash;Diana&rsquo;s&mdash;blood run cold; Ruby Gillis had charmed all her warts away, true&rsquo;s you live, with a magic pebble that old Mary Joe from the Creek gave her. You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go.</p></div> </div>
