<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart&mdash;&lsquo;The Battle of Hohenlinden&rsquo; and &lsquo;Edinburgh after Flodden,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bingen of the Rhine,&rsquo; and most of the &lsquo;Lady of the Lake&rsquo; and most of &lsquo;The Seasons&rsquo; by James Thompson. Don&rsquo;t you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader&mdash;&lsquo;The Downfall of Poland&rsquo;&mdash;that is just full of thrills. Of course, I wasn&rsquo;t in the Fifth Reader&mdash;I was only in the Fourth&mdash;but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were those women&mdash;Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond&mdash;good to you?&rdquo; asked Marilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her eye.</p></div> </div>
