<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got &lsquo;evening dresses,&rsquo; as they call them, and I don&rsquo;t mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me pick it in town last week, and we&rsquo;ll get Emily Gillis to make it for you. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren&rsquo;t to be equaled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it&rsquo;s just lovely,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Thank you so much. I don&rsquo;t believe you ought to be so kind to me&mdash;it&rsquo;s making it harder every day for me to go away.&rdquo;</p><p>The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily&rsquo;s taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew&rsquo;s and Marilla&rsquo;s benefit, and recited &ldquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Vow&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
