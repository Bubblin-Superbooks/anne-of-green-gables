<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn&rsquo;t wash off. In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he&rsquo;d sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as soon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you. And I&rsquo;ve been repenting ever since.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
