<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced girl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very sorry for me, Marilla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was your own fault,&rdquo; said Marilla, twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp.</p><p>&ldquo;And that is just why you should be sorry for me,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would you have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
