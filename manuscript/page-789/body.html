I&rsquo;ve done my best and I begin to understand what is meant by the &lsquo;joy of the strife.&rsquo; Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing. Girls, don&rsquo;t talk about exams! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark beech-woods back of Avonlea.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
