<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose I could do it to oblige you,&rdquo; said Anne thoughtfully. &ldquo;It would be true enough to say I am sorry, because I am sorry now. I wasn&rsquo;t a bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all night. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just furious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn&rsquo;t in a temper anymore&mdash;and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed of myself. But I just couldn&rsquo;t think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I&rsquo;d stay shut up here forever rather than do that. But still&mdash;I&rsquo;d do anything for you&mdash;if you really want me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
