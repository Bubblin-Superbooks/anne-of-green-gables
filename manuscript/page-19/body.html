<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite of&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;their dissimilarity.</p><p>Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she was; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all pretty well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel. &ldquo;I was kind of afraid you weren&rsquo;t, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe he was going to the doctor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
