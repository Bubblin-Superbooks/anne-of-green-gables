<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with &lsquo;May I see you home?&rsquo; on it. I&rsquo;m to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can&rsquo;t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know you&rsquo;ll tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
