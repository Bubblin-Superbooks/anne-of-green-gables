<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what on earth you mean. If Cordelia isn&rsquo;t your name, what is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley,&rdquo; reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, &ldquo;but, oh, please do call me Cordelia. It can&rsquo;t matter much to you what you call me if I&rsquo;m only going to be here a little while, can it? And Anne is such an unromantic name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unromantic fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said the unsympathetic Marilla. &ldquo;Anne is a real good plain sensible name. You&rsquo;ve no need to be ashamed of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not ashamed of it,&rdquo; explained Anne, &ldquo;only I like Cordelia better. I&rsquo;ve always imagined that my name was Cordelia&mdash;at least, I always have of late years. When I was young I used to imagine it was Geraldine, but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me Anne please call me Anne spelled with an E.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
