It looks so much nicer. When you hear a name pronounced can&rsquo;t you always see it in your mind, just as if it was printed out? I can; and A-n-n looks dreadful, but A-n-n-e looks so much more distinguished. If you&rsquo;ll only call me Anne spelled with an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this mistake came to be made? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy. Were there no boys at the asylum?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
