Well now&mdash;well now.&rdquo;</p><p>For Anne&rsquo;s eyes had suddenly filled with tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Like it! Oh, Matthew!&rdquo; Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped her hands. &ldquo;Matthew, it&rsquo;s perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy dream.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, let us have breakfast,&rdquo; interrupted Marilla. &ldquo;I must say, Anne, I don&rsquo;t think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it for you, see that you take good care of it. There&rsquo;s a hair ribbon Mrs. Lynde left for you. It&rsquo;s brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
