<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to eat breakfast,&rdquo; said Anne rapturously. &ldquo;Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I&rsquo;d rather feast my eyes on that dress. I&rsquo;m so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable. It did seem to me that I&rsquo;d never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them. I&rsquo;d never have felt quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It&rsquo;s at times like this I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future. But somehow it&rsquo;s hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort after this.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
