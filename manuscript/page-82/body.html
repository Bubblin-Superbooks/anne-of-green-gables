The matron of the asylum made them for me. They&rsquo;re fearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so things are always skimpy&mdash;at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate skimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that&rsquo;s one consolation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I&rsquo;ll come back in a few minutes for the candle. I daren&rsquo;t trust you to put it out yourself. You&rsquo;d likely set the place on fire.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
