Did he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; exclaimed Diana indignantly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to boast of it if he did, the horrid creature! I knew you couldn&rsquo;t guess it. Mother had a letter from Aunt Josephine today, and Aunt Josephine wants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her for the Exhibition. There!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Diana,&rdquo; whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support, &ldquo;do you really mean it? But I&rsquo;m afraid Marilla won&rsquo;t let me go. She will say that she can&rsquo;t encourage gadding about.</p></div> </div>
