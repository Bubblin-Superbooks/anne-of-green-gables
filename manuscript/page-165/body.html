<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anne, whatever are you thinking of?&rdquo; demanded Marilla sharply.</p><p>Anne came back to earth with a start.</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the picture&mdash;a rather vivid chromo entitled, &ldquo;Christ Blessing Little Children&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and I was just imagining I was one of them&mdash;that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing off by herself in the corner as if she didn&rsquo;t belong to anybody, like me. She looks lonely and sad, don&rsquo;t you think? I guess she hadn&rsquo;t any father or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would notice her&mdash;except Him. I&rsquo;m sure I know just how she felt. Her heart must have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I asked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn&rsquo;t notice her.</p></div> </div>
