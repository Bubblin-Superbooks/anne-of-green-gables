Do you suppose it&rsquo;s really right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is abominably wicked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ruby, you shouldn&rsquo;t talk about Mrs. Lynde,&rdquo; said Anne severely. &ldquo;It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde was born. Jane, you arrange this. It&rsquo;s silly for Elaine to be talking when she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Jane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne&rsquo;s folded hands was all that could be desired.</p></div> </div>
