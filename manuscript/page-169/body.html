I&rsquo;ve heard it before&mdash;I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it over once. But I didn&rsquo;t like it then. He had such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he thought praying was a disagreeable duty. This isn&rsquo;t poetry, but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does. &lsquo;Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name.&rsquo; That is just like a line of music. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you thought of making me learn this, Miss&mdash;Marilla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, learn it and hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Marilla shortly.</p></div> </div>
