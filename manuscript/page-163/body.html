<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose I was very awkward,&rdquo; said Anne apologetically, &ldquo;but then, you see, I&rsquo;d never had any practice. You couldn&rsquo;t really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a splendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would. It was nearly as long as a minister&rsquo;s and so poetical. But would you believe it? I couldn&rsquo;t remember one word when I woke up this morning. And I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll never be able to think out another one as good. Somehow, things never are so good when they&rsquo;re thought out a second time. Have you ever noticed that?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
