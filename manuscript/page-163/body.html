And that reminds me. Go into the sitting room, Anne&mdash;be sure your feet are clean and don&rsquo;t let any flies in&mdash;and bring me out the illustrated card that&rsquo;s on the mantelpiece. The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is on it and you&rsquo;ll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There&rsquo;s to be no more of such praying as I heard last night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
