And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can&rsquo;t bear a boy with goggle eyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I&rsquo;d never get over it, Diana Barry. But it is nice to keep head of your class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have Gilbert in your class after this,&rdquo; said Diana, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s used to being head of his class, I can tell you. He&rsquo;s only in the fourth book although he&rsquo;s nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him. They were there three years and Gil didn&rsquo;t go to school hardly any until they came back. You won&rsquo;t find it so easy to keep head after this, Anne.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
