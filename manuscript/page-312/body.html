I got up yesterday spelling &lsquo;ebullition.&rsquo; Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped in her book. Mr. Phillips didn&rsquo;t see her&mdash;he was looking at Prissy Andrews&mdash;but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those Pye girls are cheats all round,&rdquo; said Diana indignantly, as they climbed the fence of the main road. &ldquo;Gertie Pye actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I don&rsquo;t speak to her now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
