Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert Blythe to the end of life.</p><p>As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s the matter now, Anne?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Diana,&rdquo; sobbed Anne luxuriously. &ldquo;I love Diana so, Marilla. I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do? I hate her husband&mdash;I just hate him furiously.</p></div> </div>
