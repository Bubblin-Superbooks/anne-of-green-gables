<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Minnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen sofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children during her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.</p><p>Anne went to work with skill and promptness.</p><p>&ldquo;Minnie May has croup all right; she&rsquo;s pretty bad, but I&rsquo;ve seen them worse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there isn&rsquo;t more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I&rsquo;ve filled it up, and, Mary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you&rsquo;d any imagination.</p></div> </div>
