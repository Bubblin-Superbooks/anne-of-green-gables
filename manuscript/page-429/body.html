Anne reveled in the drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the snow crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire. Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Diana,&rdquo; breathed Anne, squeezing Diana&rsquo;s mittened hand under the fur robe, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really look the same as usual? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
