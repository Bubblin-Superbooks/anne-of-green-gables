<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt&rsquo;s pantry and she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt that way. I&rsquo;d have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it, and I&rsquo;d have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d feel, Marilla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The way I feel at present, Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;is that it&rsquo;s high time you had those dishes washed. You&rsquo;ve taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk afterwards.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
