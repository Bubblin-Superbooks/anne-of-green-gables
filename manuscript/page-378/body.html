Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be a model pupil,&rdquo; agreed Anne dolefully. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be much fun in it, I expect. Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model pupil and there isn&rsquo;t a spark of imagination or life in her. She is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. But I feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now. I&rsquo;m going round by the road. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to go by the Birch Path all alone. I should weep bitter tears if I did.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
