<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well now, I just can&rsquo;t recollect that I ever had.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have it lots of time&mdash;whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But they shouldn&rsquo;t call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning in a name like that. They should call it&mdash;let me see&mdash;the White Way of Delight. Isn&rsquo;t that a nice imaginative name? When I don&rsquo;t like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. Have we really only another mile to go before we get home? I&rsquo;m glad and I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I&rsquo;m always sorry when pleasant things end.</p></div> </div>
