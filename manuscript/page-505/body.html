<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;ve had a most fascinating time. I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph. I really think I&rsquo;d like to be a minister&rsquo;s wife when I grow up, Marilla. A minister mightn&rsquo;t mind my red hair because he wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I&rsquo;ll never be that, so I suppose there&rsquo;s no use in thinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not. I&rsquo;m one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I&rsquo;m full of original sin.</p></div> </div>
