<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Diana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered. She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother&rsquo;s black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father.</p><p>&ldquo;This is my little girl Diana,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barry. &ldquo;Diana, you might take Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers. It will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely too much&mdash;&rdquo; this to Marilla as the little girls went out&mdash;&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t prevent her, for her father aids and abets her. She&rsquo;s always poring over a book. I&rsquo;m glad she has the prospect of a playmate&mdash;perhaps it will take her more out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
