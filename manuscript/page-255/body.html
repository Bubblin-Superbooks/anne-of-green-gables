There, there, child, don&rsquo;t look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew has gone and got them. He&rsquo;d better have brought you peppermints. They&rsquo;re wholesomer. Don&rsquo;t sicken yourself eating all them at once now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just eat one tonight, Marilla. And I can give Diana half of them, can&rsquo;t I? The other half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It&rsquo;s delightful to think I have something to give her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
