<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will say it for the child,&rdquo; said Marilla when Anne had gone to her gable, &ldquo;she isn&rsquo;t stingy. I&rsquo;m glad, for of all faults I detest stinginess in a child. Dear me, it&rsquo;s only three weeks since she came, and it seems as if she&rsquo;d been here always. I can&rsquo;t imagine the place without her. Now, don&rsquo;t be looking I told-you-so, Matthew. That&rsquo;s bad enough in a woman, but it isn&rsquo;t to be endured in a man. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to own up that I&rsquo;m glad I consented to keep the child and that I&rsquo;m getting fond of her, but don&rsquo;t you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
