Good night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience,&rdquo; said Anne, cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.</p><p>Marilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table, and glared at Matthew.</p><p>&ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, it&rsquo;s about time somebody adopted that child and taught her something. She&rsquo;s next door to a perfect heathen. Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? I&rsquo;ll send her to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do. And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can get some suitable clothes made for her. I foresee that I shall have my hands full. Well, well, we can&rsquo;t get through this world without our share of trouble.</p></div> </div>
