Life was certainly very interesting.</p><p>In the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend. Miss Stacy was a bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally. Anne expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring Matthew and the critical Marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims.</p><p>&ldquo;I love Miss Stacy with my whole heart, Marilla. She is so ladylike and she has such a sweet voice. When she pronounces my name I feel instinctively that she&rsquo;s spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon. I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite &lsquo;Mary, Queen of Scots.&rsquo; I just put my whole soul into it.</p></div> </div>
