<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There were some things Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl&rsquo;s dress.</p><p>After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson&rsquo;s store instead of William Blair&rsquo;s. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to William Blair&rsquo;s; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William Blair&rsquo;s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew held them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter as this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson&rsquo;s, where Samuel or his son would wait on him.</p></div> </div>
