But mostly when I&rsquo;m with Mrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me I oughtn&rsquo;t to do. I feel irresistibly tempted to do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m really bad and unregenerate?&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla looked dubious for a moment.
