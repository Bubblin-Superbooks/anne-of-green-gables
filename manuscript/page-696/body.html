I sometimes think she&rsquo;d have more of an influence for good, as you say yourself, if she didn&rsquo;t keep nagging people to do right. There should have been a special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn&rsquo;t talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well. There isn&rsquo;t a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you feel the same,&rdquo; said Anne decidedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so encouraging. I shan&rsquo;t worry so much over that after this. But I dare say there&rsquo;ll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the time&mdash;things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and there&rsquo;s another right after.</p></div> </div>
