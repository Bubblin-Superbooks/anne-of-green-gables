A little gypsy wind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young dew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came close to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman&rsquo;s hard palm.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely to be going home and know it&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I love Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever seemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;m so happy. I could pray right now and not find it a bit hard.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
