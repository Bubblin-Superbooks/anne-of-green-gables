<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>IT was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky.</p><p>For a moment she could not remember where she was. First came a delightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible remembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn&rsquo;t want her because she wasn&rsquo;t a boy!</p><p>But it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside of her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor. She pushed up the sash&mdash;it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn&rsquo;t been opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight that nothing was needed to hold it up.</p></div> </div>
