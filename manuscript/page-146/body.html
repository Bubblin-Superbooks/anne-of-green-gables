<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>WHEN Marilla took Anne up to bed that night she said stiffly:</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can&rsquo;t allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair. I haven&rsquo;t any use at all for little girls who aren&rsquo;t neat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn&rsquo;t think about my clothes at all,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fold them nicely tonight. They always made us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I&rsquo;d forget, I&rsquo;d be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
