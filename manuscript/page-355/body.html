<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana, but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun&mdash;of course I&rsquo;m a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic&mdash;taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry. Diana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I&rsquo;d give the sauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples.</p></div> </div>
