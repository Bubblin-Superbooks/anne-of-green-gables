<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning. You know they are very stylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn&rsquo;t pretty. Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up, in the other. Diana, that was a terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out &lsquo;Marilla, you mustn&rsquo;t use that pudding sauce. There was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.&rsquo; Oh, Diana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred.</p></div> </div>
