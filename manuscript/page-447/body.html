It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me about yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am very sorry I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne firmly. &ldquo;I would like to, because you seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred spirit although you don&rsquo;t look very much like it. But it is my duty to go home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind lady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but it is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on the bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive Diana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
