There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond&rsquo;s. But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every word you said, even if you didn&rsquo;t talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it was a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice&mdash;not quite, but almost, you know. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta, and oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had become so attached to her that I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination there.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
