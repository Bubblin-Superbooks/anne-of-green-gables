<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled with them. Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and worshiping eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; she told Diana, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m going through here I don&rsquo;t really care whether Gil&mdash;whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not. But when I&rsquo;m up in school it&rsquo;s all different and I care as much as ever. There&rsquo;s such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is why I&rsquo;m such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would be ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn&rsquo;t be half so interesting.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
