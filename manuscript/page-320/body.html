The iron has entered into my soul, Diana.&rdquo;</p><p>Diana hadn&rsquo;t the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was something terrible.</p><p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,&rdquo; she said soothingly. &ldquo;Why, he makes fun of all the girls. He laughs at mine because it&rsquo;s so black. He&rsquo;s called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him apologize for anything before, either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots,&rdquo; said Anne with dignity. &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe has hurt my feelings excruciatingly, Diana.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
