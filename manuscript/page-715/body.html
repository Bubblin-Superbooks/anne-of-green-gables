<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn&rsquo;t slept a wink and she didn&rsquo;t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher&rsquo;s course even if I did get through. There are times and seasons even yet when I don&rsquo;t feel that I&rsquo;ve made any great headway in learning to like Josie Pye!</p><p>&ldquo;When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself.</p></div> </div>
