<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more satisfactory than Josie Pye&rsquo;s companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared, each with an inch of Queen&rsquo;s color ribbon&mdash;purple and scarlet&mdash;pinned proudly to her coat. As Josie was not &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; to Jane just then she had to subside into comparative harmlessness.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jane with a sigh, &ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;d lived many moons since the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil&mdash;that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply couldn&rsquo;t settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the traces of tears. If you&rsquo;ve been crying do own up. It will restore my self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I don&rsquo;t mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too.</p></div> </div>
