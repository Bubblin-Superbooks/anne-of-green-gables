<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you&rsquo;d been born turning up your nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and short that you&rsquo;d really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans, with that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look. You know you wouldn&rsquo;t, Jane Andrews!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; said Jane unconvinced. &ldquo;I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life,&rdquo; declared Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads.</p></div> </div>
