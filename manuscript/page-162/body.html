Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me Marilla except the minister. He says Miss Cuthbert&mdash;when he thinks of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to call you Aunt Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne wistfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had an aunt or any relation at all&mdash;not even a grandmother. It would make me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can&rsquo;t I call you Aunt Marilla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not your aunt and I don&rsquo;t believe in calling people names that don&rsquo;t belong to them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
