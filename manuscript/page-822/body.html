<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it,&rdquo; smiled Anne, touching the heavy braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. &ldquo;I laugh a little now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t laugh much, because it was a very real trouble then. I did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone; and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now&mdash;all but Josie Pye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I&rsquo;ve almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I&rsquo;ve made what I would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won&rsquo;t be liked.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
