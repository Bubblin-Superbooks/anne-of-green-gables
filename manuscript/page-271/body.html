<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond, I read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like. I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones. When I saw a real diamond in a lady&rsquo;s ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was very lovely but it wasn&rsquo;t my idea of a diamond. Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute, Marilla? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
