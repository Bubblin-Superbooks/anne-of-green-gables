<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I behaved terribly to you&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have let me stay at Green Gables although I&rsquo;m not a boy. I&rsquo;m a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth. It was the truth; every word you said was true. My hair is red and I&rsquo;m freckled and skinny and ugly. What I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it. Oh, Mrs. Lynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a dreadful temper? Oh, I am sure you wouldn&rsquo;t. Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
