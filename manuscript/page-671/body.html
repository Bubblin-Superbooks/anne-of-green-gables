When Matthew and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not. You&rsquo;ll always have a home at Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world, and it&rsquo;s just as well to be prepared. So you can join the Queen&rsquo;s class if you like, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, thank you.&rdquo; Anne flung her arms about Marilla&rsquo;s waist and looked up earnestly into her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely grateful to you and Matthew.</p></div> </div>
