<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I used to say to them, &lsquo;Oh, you poor little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you could grow, couldn&rsquo;t you? But you can&rsquo;t where you are. I know just exactly how you feel, little trees.&rsquo; I felt sorry to leave them behind this morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don&rsquo;t you? Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, yes, there&rsquo;s one right below the house.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
