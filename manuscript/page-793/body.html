And I&rsquo;m not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody. I haven&rsquo;t the moral courage. I&rsquo;m going straight to the girls&rsquo; dressing room.

If I have failed just say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do don&rsquo;t sympathize with me. Promise me this, Jane.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
