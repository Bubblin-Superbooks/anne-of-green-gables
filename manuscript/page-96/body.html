<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big tree,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;and it blooms great, but the fruit don&rsquo;t amount to much never&mdash;small and wormy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean just the tree; of course it&rsquo;s lovely&mdash;yes, it&rsquo;s radiantly lovely&mdash;it blooms as if it meant it&mdash;but I meant everything, the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big dear world. Don&rsquo;t you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here. Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They&rsquo;re always laughing. Even in winter-time I&rsquo;ve heard them under the ice. I&rsquo;m so glad there&rsquo;s a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to me when you&rsquo;re not going to keep me, but it does.</p></div> </div>
