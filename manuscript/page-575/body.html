<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,&rdquo; said Anne disdainfully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I&rsquo;m afraid that is an uncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don&rsquo;t they? I simply can&rsquo;t talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I&rsquo;m trying to be as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she&rsquo;s perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn&rsquo;t really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else.</p></div> </div>
