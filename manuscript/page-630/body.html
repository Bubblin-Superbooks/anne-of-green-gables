Why, it&rsquo;s so romantic!&rdquo; said Jane, finding breath enough for utterance at last. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll speak to him after this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old spirit. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want ever to hear the word &lsquo;romantic&rsquo; again, Jane Andrews. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my fault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape.
