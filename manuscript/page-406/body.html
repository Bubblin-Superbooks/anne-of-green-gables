<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy eyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the Lover&rsquo;s Lane maples.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Matthew, isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful morning? The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn&rsquo;t it? Those trees look as if I could blow them away with a breath&mdash;pouf! I&rsquo;m so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren&rsquo;t you? And I&rsquo;m so glad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all. If she hadn&rsquo;t I mightn&rsquo;t have known what to do for Minnie May. I&rsquo;m real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins. But, oh, Matthew, I&rsquo;m so sleepy. I can&rsquo;t go to school.</p></div> </div>
