<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,&rdquo; sobbed Anne. &ldquo;The tears don&rsquo;t hurt me like that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me&mdash;so. I couldn&rsquo;t have Diana stay, she&rsquo;s good and kind and sweet&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not her sorrow&mdash;she&rsquo;s outside of it and she couldn&rsquo;t come close enough to my heart to help me. It&rsquo;s our sorrow&mdash;yours and mine. Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got each other, Anne. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do if you weren&rsquo;t here&mdash;if you&rsquo;d never come. Oh, Anne, I know I&rsquo;ve been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe&mdash;but you mustn&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t love you as well as Matthew did, for all that.</p></div> </div>
