<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie says. I&rsquo;m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I haven&rsquo;t any of my own. It&rsquo;s necessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the organ.</p></div> </div>
