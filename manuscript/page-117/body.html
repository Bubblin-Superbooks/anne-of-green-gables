<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m glad she was satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her&mdash;because she didn&rsquo;t live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she&rsquo;d lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say &lsquo;mother,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits&rsquo; end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn&rsquo;t any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she&rsquo;d take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband.</p></div> </div>
