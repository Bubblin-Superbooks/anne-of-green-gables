<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Miss Barry stayed her month out and over. She was a more agreeable guest than usual, for Anne kept her in good humor. They became firm friends.</p><p>When Miss Barry went away she said:</p><p>&ldquo;Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you&rsquo;re to visit me and I&rsquo;ll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all,&rdquo; Anne confided to Marilla. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think so to look at her, but she is. You don&rsquo;t find it right out at first, as in Matthew&rsquo;s case, but after a while you come to see it. Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It&rsquo;s splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
