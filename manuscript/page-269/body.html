A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had bequeathed it to Marilla. It was an old-fashioned oval, containing a braid of her mother&rsquo;s hair, surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts. Marilla knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were; but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat, above her good brown satin dress, even although she could not see it.</p><p>Anne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that brooch.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it&rsquo;s a perfectly elegant brooch. I don&rsquo;t know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on. I couldn&rsquo;t, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet. They are what I used to think diamonds were like.</p></div> </div>
