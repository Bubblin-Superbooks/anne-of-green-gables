<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Just one awful moment&mdash;Diana, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables&mdash;and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again&mdash;I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!&mdash;for I knew I could do something with that paper anyhow.</p><p>&ldquo;At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh, Diana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning.</p></div> </div>
