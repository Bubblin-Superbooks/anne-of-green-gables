<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lover&rsquo;s Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter. Anne had named it Lover&rsquo;s Lane before she had been a month at Green Gables.</p><p>&ldquo;Not that lovers ever really walk there,&rdquo; she explained to Marilla, &ldquo;but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there&rsquo;s a Lover&rsquo;s Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it&rsquo;s a very pretty name, don&rsquo;t you think? So romantic! We can&rsquo;t imagine the lovers into it, you know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
