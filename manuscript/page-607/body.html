<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne&rsquo;s clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday, but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie Pye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything when Josie said that to me,&rdquo; Anne confided that evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches, &ldquo;because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently. It&rsquo;s hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to say something back. But I didn&rsquo;t. I just swept her one scornful look and then I forgave her. It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn&rsquo;t it? I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again. Of course it&rsquo;s better to be good.</p></div> </div>
