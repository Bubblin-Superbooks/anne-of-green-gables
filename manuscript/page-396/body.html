<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It must be rather interesting, don&rsquo;t you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis says when she grows up she&rsquo;s going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too exciting. I&rsquo;d rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening. He says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queen&rsquo;s too, and I should think she needed help a lot more than Prissy because she&rsquo;s ever so much stupider, but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this world that I can&rsquo;t understand very well, Matthew.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
