<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,&rdquo; acknowledged Matthew.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won&rsquo;t allow myself to open that new book Jane lent me until I&rsquo;m through. But it&rsquo;s a terrible temptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there just as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book that makes me cry. But I think I&rsquo;ll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must not give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if I implore you on my bended knees. It&rsquo;s all very well to say resist temptation, but it&rsquo;s ever so much easier to resist it if you can&rsquo;t get the key.</p></div> </div>
