The morning, in spite of Matthew&rsquo;s predictions, was fine and Anne&rsquo;s spirits soared to their highest. &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see,&rdquo; she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how good I feel! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if it could last? I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day. But oh, Marilla, it&rsquo;s a solemn occasion too. I feel so anxious. What if I shouldn&rsquo;t behave properly?
