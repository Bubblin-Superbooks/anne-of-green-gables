I&rsquo;m sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great, although I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it was better than Mrs. Evans&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, don&rsquo;t say things like that, Jane,&rdquo; said Anne quickly, &ldquo;because it sounds silly. It couldn&rsquo;t be better than Mrs. Evans&rsquo;s, you know, for she is a professional, and I&rsquo;m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting. I&rsquo;m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
