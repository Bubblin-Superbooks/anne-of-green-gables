To be sure I will. I&rsquo;m going to Carmody tomorrow and I&rsquo;ll attend to it. Have you something particular in mind? No? Well, I&rsquo;ll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria in that&rsquo;s real pretty. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like me to make it up for her, too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I&rsquo;ll do it. No, it isn&rsquo;t a mite of trouble. I like sewing. I&rsquo;ll make it to fit my niece, Jenny Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
