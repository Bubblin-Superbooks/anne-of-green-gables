<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I was awfully near giving up in despair,&rdquo; explained Anne. &ldquo;She got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were, even the last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death. I gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I said to myself&mdash;not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I didn&rsquo;t want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings&mdash;&lsquo;This is the last lingering hope and I fear, tis a vain one.&rsquo; But in about three minutes she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away. You must just imagine my relief, doctor, because I can&rsquo;t express it in words. You know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
