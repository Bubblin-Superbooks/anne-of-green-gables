<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Confess what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I suggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure. Diana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it is to blame her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at least. Such carryings on in a respectable house!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we were only in fun,&rdquo; persisted Anne. &ldquo;I think you ought to forgive us, Miss Barry, now that we&rsquo;ve apologized. And anyhow, please forgive Diana and let her have her music lessons. Diana&rsquo;s heart is set on her music lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be cross with me.</p></div> </div>
