Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light. Every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples. The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and the tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s good to be alive and to be going home,&rdquo; breathed Anne.</p></div> </div>
