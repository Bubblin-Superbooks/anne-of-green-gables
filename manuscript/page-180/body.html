And good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I wonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall love her very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice and Violetta. They would feel so hurt if I did and I&rsquo;d hate to hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings, even a little bookcase girl&rsquo;s or a little echo girl&rsquo;s. I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
