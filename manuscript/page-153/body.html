<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Gracious heavenly Father, I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny and the Snow Queen. I&rsquo;m really extremely grateful for them. And that&rsquo;s all the blessings I can think of just now to thank Thee for. As for the things I want, they&rsquo;re so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all so I will only mention the two most important. Please let me stay at Green Gables; and please let me be good-looking when I grow up. I remain, &ldquo;Yours respectfully, Anne Shirley.</p><p>&ldquo;There, did I do all right?&rdquo; she asked eagerly, getting up. &ldquo;I could have made it much more flowery if I&rsquo;d had a little more time to think it over.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
