<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September with many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she get on with the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?</p><p>Things went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that evening in high spirits.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to like school here,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of the master, through. He&rsquo;s all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you know. She&rsquo;s sixteen and she&rsquo;s studying for the entrance examination into Queen&rsquo;s Academy at Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the master is dead gone on her. She&rsquo;s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly.</p></div> </div>
