<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Matthew and Marilla don&rsquo;t know anything about children and they&rsquo;ll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so be&rsquo;s he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow; there&rsquo;s never been one there, for Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built&mdash;if they ever were children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them. I wouldn&rsquo;t be in that orphan&rsquo;s shoes for anything. My, but I pity him, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p><p>So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been still deeper and more profound.</p></div> </div>
