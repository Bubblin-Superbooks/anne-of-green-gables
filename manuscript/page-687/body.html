<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Matthew had a bad spell with his heart Thursday,&rdquo; Marilla explained, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t feel like leaving him. Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s all right again now, but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I&rsquo;m anxious about him. The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement. That&rsquo;s easy enough, for Matthew doesn&rsquo;t go about looking for excitement by any means and never did, but he&rsquo;s not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work. Come and lay off your things, Rachel. You&rsquo;ll stay to tea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, seeing you&rsquo;re so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else.</p></div> </div>
