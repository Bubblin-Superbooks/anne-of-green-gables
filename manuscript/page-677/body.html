<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education&rsquo;s sake, because she won&rsquo;t have to earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity&mdash;they have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to be a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn&rsquo;t be anything else with a name like that to live up to. I hope it isn&rsquo;t wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. He&rsquo;s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he&rsquo;s going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he&rsquo;ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it&rsquo;s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
