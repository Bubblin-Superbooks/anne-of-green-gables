<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you! I can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, she&rsquo;s a real interesting little thing,&rdquo; persisted Matthew. &ldquo;You should have heard her talk coming from the station.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she can talk fast enough. I saw that at once. It&rsquo;s nothing in her favour, either. I don&rsquo;t like children who have so much to say. I don&rsquo;t want an orphan girl and if I did she isn&rsquo;t the style I&rsquo;d pick out. There&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t understand about her. No, she&rsquo;s got to be despatched straight-way back to where she came from.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
