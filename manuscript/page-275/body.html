<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be. It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last person to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth at once. Did you take it out and lose it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla&rsquo;s angry gaze squarely. &ldquo;I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth, if I was to be led to the block for it&mdash;although I&rsquo;m not very certain what a block is. So there, Marilla.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
