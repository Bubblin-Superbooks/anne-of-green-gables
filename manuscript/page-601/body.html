<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Who said? Who are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The peddler that was here this afternoon. I bought the dye from him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those Italians in the house! I don&rsquo;t believe in encouraging them to come around at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t let him in the house. I remembered what you told me, and I went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step. Besides, he wasn&rsquo;t an Italian&mdash;he was a German Jew. He had a big box full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye.</p></div> </div>
