<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of course I promised Diana that no Queen&rsquo;s girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear to me as she is; but I&rsquo;ve lots of second-best affections to bestow. I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist. She looks vivid and red-rosy; there&rsquo;s that pale, fair one gazing out of the window. She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two about dreams. I&rsquo;d like to know them both&mdash;know them well&mdash;well enough to walk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just now I don&rsquo;t know them and they don&rsquo;t know me, and probably don&rsquo;t want to know me particularly. Oh, it&rsquo;s lonesome!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
