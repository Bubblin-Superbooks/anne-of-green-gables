<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> She&rsquo;s a real pretty girl got to be, though I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself. I like more snap and color, like Diana Barry has or Ruby Gillis. Ruby Gillis&rsquo;s looks are real showy. But somehow&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how it is but when Anne and them are together, though she ain&rsquo;t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common and overdone&mdash;something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
