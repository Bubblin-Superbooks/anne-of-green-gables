You&rsquo;re more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,&rdquo; cried Anne contritely. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say another word&mdash;not one. I know I talk too much, but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d give me some credit for it.
