<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But you&rsquo;re so featherbrained, Anne, I&rsquo;ve been waiting to see if you&rsquo;d sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin. You&rsquo;ve got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over creation. Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not like patchwork,&rdquo; said Anne dolefully, hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh. &ldquo;I think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but there&rsquo;s no scope for imagination in patchwork. It&rsquo;s just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere. But of course I&rsquo;d rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any other place with nothing to do but play.</p></div> </div>
