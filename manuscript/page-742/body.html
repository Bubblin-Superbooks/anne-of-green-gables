<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll get along without it when I go to town next month.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of your going away tonight,&rdquo; begged Diana. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time this evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And are you nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;ve recited so often in public I don&rsquo;t mind at all now. I&rsquo;ve decided to give &lsquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Vow.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s so pathetic. Laura Spencer is going to give a comic recitation, but I&rsquo;d rather make people cry than laugh.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
