<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So the trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that I ought to take it,&rdquo; murmured Anne. &ldquo;I mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for&mdash;for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you can&rsquo;t prevent him now. He&rsquo;s signed papers with the White Sands trustees. So it wouldn&rsquo;t do him any good now if you were to refuse. Of course you&rsquo;ll take the school. You&rsquo;ll get along all right, now that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a good thing she was, that&rsquo;s what. There&rsquo;s been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn&rsquo;t their home. Bless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry gable mean?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
