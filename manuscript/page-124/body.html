What a starved, unloved life she had had&mdash;a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect; for Marilla was shrewd enough to read between the lines of Anne&rsquo;s history and divine the truth. No wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home. It was a pity she had to be sent back. What if she, Marilla, should indulge Matthew&rsquo;s unaccountable whim and let her stay? He was set on it; and the child seemed a nice, teachable little thing.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got too much to say,&rdquo; thought Marilla, &ldquo;but she might be trained out of that. And there&rsquo;s nothing rude or slangy in what she does say. She&rsquo;s ladylike. It&rsquo;s likely her people were nice folks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
