I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it. I&rsquo;ll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson&mdash;because Mrs. Lynde was too far away&mdash;to show me your pew. I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a minister I&rsquo;d pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn&rsquo;t think he was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he hasn&rsquo;t enough imagination. I didn&rsquo;t listen to him very much. I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
