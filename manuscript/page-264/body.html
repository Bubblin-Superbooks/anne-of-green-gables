<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when I&rsquo;m playing with Diana, though. Oh, we do have such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the imagination, but I&rsquo;m well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in every other way. You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry&rsquo;s. It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees&mdash;the most romantic spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse there. We call it Idlewild. Isn&rsquo;t that a poetical name? I assure you it took me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration. Diana was enraptured when she heard it. We have got our house fixed up elegantly.</p></div> </div>
