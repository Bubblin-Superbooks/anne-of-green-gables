I&rsquo;d ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that. But when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born, then. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I&rsquo;m going to shut my eyes tight. I&rsquo;m always afraid going over bridges. I can&rsquo;t help imagining that perhaps just as we get to the middle, they&rsquo;ll crumple up like a jack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them for all when I think we&rsquo;re getting near the middle. Because, you see, if the bridge did crumple up I&rsquo;d want to see it crumple. What a jolly rumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it.</p></div> </div>
