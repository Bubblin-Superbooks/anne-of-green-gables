Once again her method had succeeded; but her success was very bitter to her. &ldquo;Let me hear what you have to say then, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I took the amethyst brooch,&rdquo; said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she had learned. &ldquo;I took it just as you said. I didn&rsquo;t mean to take it when I went in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the brooch.</p></div> </div>
