<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I told her everything&mdash;about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don&rsquo;t know how that encouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it&rsquo;s a lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn&rsquo;t that a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says they&rsquo;ve never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to live through the two weeks before school begins. I&rsquo;m so impatient to see her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
