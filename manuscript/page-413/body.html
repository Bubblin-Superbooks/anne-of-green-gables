Diana gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry:&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you love me as I love you Nothing but death can part us two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that is true, Marilla. We&rsquo;re going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us sit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews. We had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out, Marilla, just as if I was real company. I can&rsquo;t tell you what a thrill it gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before. And we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves, Marilla.</p></div> </div>
