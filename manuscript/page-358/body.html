In vain Anne pleaded.</p><p>&ldquo;I never heard of company going home without tea,&rdquo; she mourned. &ldquo;Oh, Diana, do you suppose that it&rsquo;s possible you&rsquo;re really taking the smallpox? If you are I&rsquo;ll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I&rsquo;ll never forsake you. But I do wish you&rsquo;d stay till after tea. Where do you feel bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful dizzy,&rdquo; said Diana.</p><p>And indeed, she walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment in her eyes, got Diana&rsquo;s hat and went with her as far as the Barry yard fence. Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone out of the performance.</p></div> </div>
