<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There were other changes in Anne no less real than the physical change. For one thing, she became much quieter. Perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less. Marilla noticed and commented on this also.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half as many big words. What has come over you?&rdquo;</p><p>Anne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to talk as much,&rdquo; she said, denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one&rsquo;s heart, like treasures.</p></div> </div>
