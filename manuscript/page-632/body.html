<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn&rsquo;t belong to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair and nose now&mdash;at least, very seldom. And today&rsquo;s mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; said Marilla skeptically.</p></div> </div>
