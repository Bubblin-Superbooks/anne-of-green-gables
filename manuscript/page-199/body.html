<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You were rude and saucy and&rdquo;&mdash;Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment&mdash;&ldquo;you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can never do that,&rdquo; said Anne determinedly and darkly. &ldquo;You can punish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark, damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,&rdquo; said Marilla drily, &ldquo;especially as they&rsquo;re rather scarce in Avonlea. But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you&rsquo;ll stay here in your room until you can tell me you&rsquo;re willing to do it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
