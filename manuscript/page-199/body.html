How can I? I&rsquo;m not sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve vexed you; but I&rsquo;m glad I told her just what I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry when I&rsquo;m not, can I? I can&rsquo;t even imagine I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning,&rdquo; said Marilla, rising to depart. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but I must say it hasn&rsquo;t seemed very much like it this evening.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
