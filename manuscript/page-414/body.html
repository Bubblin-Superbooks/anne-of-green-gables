But the making of it was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come over as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to Lover&rsquo;s Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I feel like praying tonight and I&rsquo;m going to think out a special brand-new prayer in honor of the occasion.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
