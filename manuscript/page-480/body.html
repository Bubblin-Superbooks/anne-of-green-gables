<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,&rdquo; she announced one Sunday afternoon. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s taken our class and she&rsquo;s a splendid teacher. She said right away she didn&rsquo;t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions, and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I&rsquo;ve always thought. She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many. I&rsquo;m good at asking questions, Marilla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s emphatic comment.</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn&rsquo;t think that was a very proper question to ask because it hadn&rsquo;t any connection with the lesson&mdash;the lesson was about Daniel in the lions&rsquo; den&mdash;</p></div> </div>
