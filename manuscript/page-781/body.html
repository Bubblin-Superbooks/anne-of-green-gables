Ruby Gillis told Jane Andrews that she didn&rsquo;t understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said; he talked just like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for her part she didn&rsquo;t think it any fun to be bothering about books and that sort of thing when you didn&rsquo;t have to. Frank Stockley had lots more dash and go, but then he wasn&rsquo;t half as good-looking as Gilbert and she really couldn&rsquo;t decide which she liked best!</p><p>In the Academy Anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about her, thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself.</p></div> </div>
