<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it&rsquo;s easier than the one you&rsquo;ve got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of taking about her after all. I don&rsquo;t feel so surprised at you and Matthew keeping her as I did&mdash;nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all right. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself&mdash;a little too&mdash;well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she&rsquo;ll likely get over that now that she&rsquo;s come to live among civilized folks. And then, her temper&rsquo;s pretty quick, I guess; but there&rsquo;s one comfort, a child that has a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain&rsquo;t never likely to be sly or deceitful. Preserve me from a sly child, that&rsquo;s what. On the whole, Marilla, I kind of like her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
