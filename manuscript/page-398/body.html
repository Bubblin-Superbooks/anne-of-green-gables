Wouldn&rsquo;t you like some russets?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, I dunno but what I would,&rdquo; said Matthew, who never ate russets but knew Anne&rsquo;s weakness for them.</p><p>Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana Barry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head. Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise, and plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day, by Marilla, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadn&rsquo;t been set on fire.</p></div> </div>
