<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>OCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths.</p><p>Anne reveled in the world of color about her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Look at these maple branches. Don&rsquo;t they give you a thrill&mdash;several thrills? I&rsquo;m going to decorate my room with them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
