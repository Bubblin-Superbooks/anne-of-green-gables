If I could be good I&rsquo;d dance and sing all day because I was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it wouldn&rsquo;t be dignified in a minister&rsquo;s wife. But I can just feel she&rsquo;s glad she&rsquo;s a Christian and that she&rsquo;d be one even if she could get to heaven without it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
