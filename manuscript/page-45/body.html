<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn&rsquo;t sell it, but I&rsquo;d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn&rsquo;t you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress&mdash;because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while&mdash;and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might. I wasn&rsquo;t a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn&rsquo;t time to get sick, watching to see that I didn&rsquo;t fall overboard.</p></div> </div>
