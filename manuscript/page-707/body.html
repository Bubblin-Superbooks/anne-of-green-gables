Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll be all right&mdash;and then I get horribly afraid. We&rsquo;ve studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us thoroughly, but we mayn&rsquo;t get through for all that. We&rsquo;ve each got a stumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane&rsquo;s is Latin, and Ruby and Charlie&rsquo;s is algebra, and Josie&rsquo;s is arithmetic. Moody Spurgeon says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English history. Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we&rsquo;ll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we&rsquo;ll have some idea. I wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me.</p></div> </div>
