<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or not,&rdquo; said Anne resolutely. &ldquo;If I did and then was disappointed, it would be more than I could bear. But in case I do go I&rsquo;m very glad my new coat will be ready by that time. Marilla didn&rsquo;t think I needed a new coat. She said my old one would do very well for another winter and that I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress. The dress is very pretty, Diana&mdash;navy blue and made so fashionably. Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now, because she says she doesn&rsquo;t intend to have Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them. I&rsquo;m so glad. It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is easier for me. I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t make such a difference to naturally good people.</p></div> </div>
