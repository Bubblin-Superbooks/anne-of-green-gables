<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover&rsquo;s Lane as far as the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples&mdash;&ldquo;maples are such sociable trees,&rdquo; said Anne; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re always rustling and whispering to you&rdquo;&mdash;until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane and walked through Mr. Barry&rsquo;s back field and past Willowmere. Beyond Willowmere came Violet Vale&mdash;a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew Bell&rsquo;s big woods. &ldquo;Of course there are no violets there now,&rdquo; Anne told Marilla, &ldquo;but Diana says there are millions of them in spring. Oh, Marilla, can&rsquo;t you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away my breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places.</p></div> </div>
