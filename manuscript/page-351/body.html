Take as much as you want. I&rsquo;m going to run out and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a person&rsquo;s mind when they&rsquo;re keeping house, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p><p>When Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her second glassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.</p></div> </div>
