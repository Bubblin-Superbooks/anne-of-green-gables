<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s red,&rdquo; she said resignedly. &ldquo;Now you see why I can&rsquo;t be perfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don&rsquo;t mind the other things so much&mdash;the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I can imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I cannot imagine that red hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, &lsquo;Now my hair is a glorious black, black as the raven&rsquo;s wing.&rsquo; But all the time I know it is just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow. I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn&rsquo;t red hair.</p></div> </div>
