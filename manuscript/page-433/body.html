Everybody seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent. Anne and Diana tiptoed into the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened. It was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s undress here,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice and warm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it been a delightful time?&rdquo; sighed Anne rapturously. &ldquo;It must be splendid to get up and recite there.
