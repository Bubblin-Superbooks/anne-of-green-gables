<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell&rsquo;s spruce grove as usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to &ldquo;pick a chew.&rdquo; But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they picked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places, was latest of all.</p></div> </div>
