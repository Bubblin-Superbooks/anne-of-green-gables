Although I&rsquo;m really beginning to see through it a little, too. Miss Stacy makes it so clear. Still, I&rsquo;ll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection. But I love writing compositions. Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose our own subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person. It&rsquo;s hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived. Mustn&rsquo;t it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you&rsquo;re dead? Oh, I would dearly love to be remarkable. I think when I grow up I&rsquo;ll be a trained nurse and go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy. That is, if I don&rsquo;t go out as a foreign missionary.</p></div> </div>
