<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Marilla, don&rsquo;t think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are careful you won&rsquo;t lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it much hope,&rdquo; said Marilla bitterly. &ldquo;What am I to live for if I can&rsquo;t read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well be blind&mdash;or dead. And as for crying, I can&rsquo;t help that when I get lonesome. But there, it&rsquo;s no good talking about it. If you&rsquo;ll get me a cup of tea I&rsquo;ll be thankful. I&rsquo;m about done out. Don&rsquo;t say anything about this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can&rsquo;t bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
