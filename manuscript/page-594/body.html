Don&rsquo;t call her untrustworthy until you&rsquo;re sure she has disobeyed you. Mebbe it can all be explained&mdash;Anne&rsquo;s a great hand at explaining.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here when I told her to stay,&rdquo; retorted Marilla. &ldquo;I reckon she&rsquo;ll find it hard to explain that to my satisfaction. Of course I knew you&rsquo;d take her part, Matthew. But I&rsquo;m bringing her up, not you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
