<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for if she hadn&rsquo;t I know I&rsquo;d have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody. Anne&rsquo;s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it from me to deny it. But I&rsquo;m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who&rsquo;d pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea. Just the same, Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I&rsquo;m real sorry to find her so now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, I dunno,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
