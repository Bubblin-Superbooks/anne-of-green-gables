But when things begin to happen they are apt to keep on.</p><p>Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell&rsquo;s spruce grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they could keep an eye on Eben Wright&rsquo;s house, where the master boarded. When they saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse; but the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright&rsquo;s lane they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three minutes too late.</p><p>On the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone who came in late would be punished.</p></div> </div>
