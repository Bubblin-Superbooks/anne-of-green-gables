<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wrote it last Monday evening. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;The Jealous Rival; or In Death Not Divided.&rsquo; I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is the kind of critic I like. It&rsquo;s a sad, sweet story. I just cried like a child while I was writing it. It&rsquo;s about two beautiful maidens called Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
