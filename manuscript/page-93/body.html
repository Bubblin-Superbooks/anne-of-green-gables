Wasn&rsquo;t it a lovely place? Suppose she wasn&rsquo;t really going to stay here! She would imagine she was. There was scope for imagination here.</p><p>A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind.</p></div> </div>
