You seem to half believe your own imaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head. But don&rsquo;t let Mrs. Barry hear you talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she&rsquo;ll think you tell stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t talk of them to everybody&mdash;their memories are too sacred for that. But I thought I&rsquo;d like to have you know about them. Oh, look, here&rsquo;s a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom. Just think what a lovely place to live&mdash;in an apple blossom! Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it.</p></div> </div>
