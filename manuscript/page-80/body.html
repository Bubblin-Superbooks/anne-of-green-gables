<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you? Well, did you ever try to imagine you were in the depths of despair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t think you can understand what it&rsquo;s like. It&rsquo;s a very uncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you can&rsquo;t swallow anything, not even if it was a chocolate caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious. I&rsquo;ve often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I&rsquo;m going to eat them. I do hope you won&rsquo;t be offended because I can&rsquo;t eat. Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
