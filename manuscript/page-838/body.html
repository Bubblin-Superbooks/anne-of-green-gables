I&rsquo;m sixteen and a half, &lsquo;obstinate as a mule,&rsquo; as Mrs. Lynde once told me,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, don&rsquo;t you go pitying me. I don&rsquo;t like to be pitied, and there is no need for it. I&rsquo;m heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green Gables. Nobody could love it as you and I do&mdash;so we must keep it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You blessed girl!&rdquo; said Marilla, yielding. &ldquo;I feel as if you&rsquo;d given me new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college&mdash;but I know I can&rsquo;t, so I ain&rsquo;t going to try. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you though, Anne.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
