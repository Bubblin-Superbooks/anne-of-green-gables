<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It&rsquo;s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night once in a while; but as a regular thing I&rsquo;d rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I don&rsquo;t think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn&rsquo;t trying to be funny. But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.&rdquo;</p><p>Friday brought going-home time, and Mr. Barry drove in for the girls.</p></div> </div>
