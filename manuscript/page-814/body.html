She could see Matthew&rsquo;s face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening&mdash;she could hear his voice saying, &ldquo;My girl&mdash;my girl that I&rsquo;m proud of.&rdquo; Then the tears came and Anne wept her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.</p><p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there&mdash;don&rsquo;t cry so, dearie. It can&rsquo;t bring him back. It&mdash;it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it then. He&rsquo;d always been such a good, kind brother to me&mdash;but God knows best.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
