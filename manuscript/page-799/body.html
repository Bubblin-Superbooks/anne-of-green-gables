<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done splendidly, Anne. I suppose you won&rsquo;t be teaching now that you&rsquo;ve won the Avery?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to Redmond in September. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem wonderful? I&rsquo;ll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious, golden months of vacation. Jane and Ruby are going to teach. Isn&rsquo;t it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody Spurgeon and Josie Pye?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe is going to teach, too. He has to. His father can&rsquo;t afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means to earn his own way through. I expect he&rsquo;ll get the school here if Miss Ames decides to leave.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
