<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; The boys are going to have a dialogue too. And I&rsquo;m to have two recitations, Marilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it&rsquo;s a nice thrilly kind of tremble. And we&rsquo;re to have a tableau at the last&mdash;&lsquo;Faith, Hope and Charity.&rsquo; Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing hair. I&rsquo;m to be Hope, with my hands clasped&mdash;so&mdash;and my eyes uplifted. I&rsquo;m going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them, and it&rsquo;s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla. Josie Pye is sulky because she didn&rsquo;t get the part she wanted in the dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy queens must be slender.</p></div> </div>
