<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh, I&rsquo;ve dozens of plans, Marilla. I&rsquo;ve been thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and I believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen&rsquo;s my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I don&rsquo;t know what lies around the bend, but I&rsquo;m going to believe that the best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder how the road beyond it goes&mdash;what there is of green glory and soft, checkered light and shadows&mdash;what new landscapes&mdash;what new beauties&mdash;what curves and hills and valleys further on.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
