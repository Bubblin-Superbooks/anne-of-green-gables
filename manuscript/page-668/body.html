<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> She found me reading a book one day called, The Lurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me, and, oh, Marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the blood in my veins. But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome book, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it. I didn&rsquo;t mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was agonizing to give back that book without knowing how it turned out. But my love for Miss Stacy stood the test and I did. It&rsquo;s really wonderful, Marilla, what you can do when you&rsquo;re truly anxious to please a certain person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll light the lamp and get to work,&rdquo; said Marilla.</p></div> </div>
