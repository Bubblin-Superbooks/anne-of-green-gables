<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Matthew Cuthbert&rsquo;s father, as shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place living at all.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just staying, that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves. Trees aren&rsquo;t much company, though dear knows if they were there&rsquo;d be enough of them. I&rsquo;d ruther look at people.</p></div> </div>
