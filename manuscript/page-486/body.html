Diana&rsquo;s mother had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over it. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads.</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so easy to imagine there is,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Every night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don&rsquo;t give up your faith in the dryad!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
