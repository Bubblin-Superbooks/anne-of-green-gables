Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re too heedless and impulsive, child, that&rsquo;s what. You never stop to think&mdash;whatever comes into your head to say or do you say or do it without a moment&rsquo;s reflection.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s the best of it,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;Something just flashes into your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it. If you stop to think it over you spoil it all. Haven&rsquo;t you never felt that yourself, Mrs. Lynde?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
