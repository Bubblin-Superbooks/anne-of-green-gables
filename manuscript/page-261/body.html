When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later. And you needn&rsquo;t stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way, either. As for the picnic, of course you can go. You&rsquo;re a Sunday-school scholar, and it&rsquo;s not likely I&rsquo;d refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; faltered Anne, &ldquo;Diana says that everybody must take a basket of things to eat. I can&rsquo;t cook, as you know, Marilla, and&mdash;and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I&rsquo;d feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket. It&rsquo;s been preying on my mind ever since Diana told me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
