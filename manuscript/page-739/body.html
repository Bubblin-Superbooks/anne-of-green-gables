I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream will never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn&rsquo;t complain. Am I all ready now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much softer face. &ldquo;Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla. Doesn&rsquo;t she look lovely?&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.</p></div> </div>
