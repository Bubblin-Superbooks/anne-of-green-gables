<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I expect she&rsquo;ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy&rsquo;s the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when he got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays. Time was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for Anne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
