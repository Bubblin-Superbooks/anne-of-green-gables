And since you seem to want her, I suppose I&rsquo;m willing&mdash;or have to be. I&rsquo;ve been thinking over the idea until I&rsquo;ve got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I&rsquo;ve never brought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I&rsquo;ll make a terrible mess of it. But I&rsquo;ll do my best. So far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Matthew, she may stay.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
