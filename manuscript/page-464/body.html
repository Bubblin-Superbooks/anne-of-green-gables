<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh, Marilla, I wouldn&rsquo;t go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. I&rsquo;d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did ever anyone hear the like!&rdquo; ejaculated Marilla, who had listened in dumb amazement. &ldquo;Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not believe exactly,&rdquo; faltered Anne. &ldquo;At least, I don&rsquo;t believe it in daylight. But after dark, Marilla, it&rsquo;s different. That is when ghosts walk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
