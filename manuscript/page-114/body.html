I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m rather glad I have one. Are we going across the Lake of Shining Waters today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going over Barry&rsquo;s pond, if that&rsquo;s what you mean by your Lake of Shining Waters. We&rsquo;re going by the shore road.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shore road sounds nice,&rdquo; said Anne dreamily. &ldquo;Is it as nice as it sounds? Just when you said &lsquo;shore road&rsquo; I saw it in a picture in my mind, as quick as that! And White Sands is a pretty name, too; but I don&rsquo;t like it as well as Avonlea. Avonlea is a lovely name. It just sounds like music. How far is it to White Sands?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
