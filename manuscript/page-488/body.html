<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake. When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn&rsquo;t good? I used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated. Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says we&rsquo;ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what if that cake doesn&rsquo;t rise?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
