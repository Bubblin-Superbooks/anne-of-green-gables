I had a presentiment that it would be needed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you&rsquo;d require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,&rdquo; said Marilla.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,&rdquo; reflected Anne. &ldquo;I just cried because all the others did. It was Ruby Gillis started it.</p></div> </div>
