<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,&rdquo; said Marilla reflectively. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been most everywhere but here. Let me see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don&rsquo;t say a word to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he&rsquo;d find some excuse to be away that day. He&rsquo;d got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn&rsquo;t mind him, but he&rsquo;s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister, and a new minister&rsquo;s wife will frighten him to death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as secret as the dead,&rdquo; assured Anne. &ldquo;But oh, Marilla, will you let me make a cake for the occasion? I&rsquo;d love to do something for Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
