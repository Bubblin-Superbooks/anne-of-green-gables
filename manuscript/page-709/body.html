<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>WITH the end of June came the close of the term and the close of Miss Stacy&rsquo;s rule in Avonlea school. Anne and Diana walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed. Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that Miss Stacy&rsquo;s farewell words must have been quite as touching as Mr. Phillips&rsquo;s had been under similar circumstances three years before. Diana looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.</p><p>&ldquo;It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said dismally.</p><p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to feel half as badly as I do,&rdquo; said Anne, hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back again next winter, but I suppose I&rsquo;ve left the dear old school forever&mdash;if I have good luck, that is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
