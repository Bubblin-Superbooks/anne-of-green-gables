When I woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You&rsquo;ve been thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t seem such a novelty to you as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting. In two more years I&rsquo;ll be really grown up. It&rsquo;s a great comfort to think that I&rsquo;ll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she&rsquo;s fifteen,&rdquo; said Diana.</p></div> </div>
