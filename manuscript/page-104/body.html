<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; demanded Marilla.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare go out,&rdquo; said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t stay here there is no use in my loving Green Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I&rsquo;ll not be able to help loving it. It&rsquo;s hard enough now, so I won&rsquo;t make it any harder. I want to go out so much&mdash;everything seems to be calling to me, &lsquo;Anne, Anne, come out to us. Anne, Anne, we want a playmate&rsquo;&mdash;but it&rsquo;s better not.</p></div> </div>
