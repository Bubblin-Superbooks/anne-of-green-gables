<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ve pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book off by heart, even when the letters are changed. I just feel tired of everything sensible and I&rsquo;m going to let my imagination run riot for the summer. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be alarmed, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it&rsquo;s the last summer I&rsquo;ll be a little girl. Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I&rsquo;ve done this I&rsquo;ll have to put on longer skirts. She says I&rsquo;m all running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won&rsquo;t even do to believe in fairies then, I&rsquo;m afraid; so I&rsquo;m going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer. I think we&rsquo;re going to have a very gay vacation.</p></div> </div>
