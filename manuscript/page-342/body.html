Bedrooms were made to sleep in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and dream in too, Marilla. And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things. I&rsquo;m going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t drop leaves all over the stairs then. I&rsquo;m going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won&rsquo;t likely be home before dark. You&rsquo;ll have to get Matthew and Jerry their supper, so mind you don&rsquo;t forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
