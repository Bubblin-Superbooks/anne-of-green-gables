<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It was dreadful of me to forget,&rdquo; said Anne apologetically, &ldquo;but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it crowded other things out. Matthew was so good. He never scolded a bit. He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn&rsquo;t find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story, Marilla. I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and Matthew said he couldn&rsquo;t tell where the join came in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about you this time.</p></div> </div>
