She had not been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another day. The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young. Diana was at Green Gables to meet her. In her own white room, where Marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked about her and drew a long breath of happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Diana, it&rsquo;s so good to be back again. It&rsquo;s so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky&mdash;and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen. Isn&rsquo;t the breath of the mint delicious? And that tea rose&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. And it&rsquo;s good to see you again, Diana!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
