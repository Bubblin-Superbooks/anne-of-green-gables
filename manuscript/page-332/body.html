<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of Anne&rsquo;s small face. She understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use reasoning with Anne now. She&rsquo;s too worked up and I&rsquo;ve an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can make out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a rather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I&rsquo;ll just talk it over with Rachel. She&rsquo;s sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it. She&rsquo;ll have heard the whole story, too, by this time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
