<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You did just splendidly, Anne,&rdquo; puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a word. &ldquo;Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago&mdash;it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won&rsquo;t be here till tomorrow by mail&mdash;and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing. You&rsquo;ve all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon and all, although he&rsquo;s conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty well&mdash;they&rsquo;re halfway up&mdash;and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through with three marks to spare, but you&rsquo;ll see she&rsquo;ll put on as many airs as if she&rsquo;d led. Won&rsquo;t Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were me I know I&rsquo;d go crazy with joy.</p></div> </div>
