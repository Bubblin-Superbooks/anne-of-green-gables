Well now, I guess it wasn&rsquo;t a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It was a girl&mdash;my girl&mdash;my girl that I&rsquo;m proud of.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. Anne took the memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the future. Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine; the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope. Anne always remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night.</p></div> </div>
