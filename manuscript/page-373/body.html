<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THE next afternoon Anne, bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window, happened to glance out and beheld Diana down by the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble beckoning mysteriously. In a trice Anne was out of the house and flying down to the hollow, astonishment and hope struggling in her expressive eyes. But the hope faded when she saw Diana&rsquo;s dejected countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mother hasn&rsquo;t relented?&rdquo; she gasped.</p><p>Diana shook her head mournfully.</p><p>&ldquo;No; and oh, Anne, she says I&rsquo;m never to play with you again. I&rsquo;ve cried and cried and I told her it wasn&rsquo;t your fault, but it wasn&rsquo;t any use. I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to you. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she&rsquo;s timing me by the clock.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
