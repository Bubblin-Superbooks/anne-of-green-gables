Hurry and take off your things, and we&rsquo;ll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got back, I must say. It&rsquo;s been fearful lonesome here without you, and I never put in four longer days.&rdquo;</p><p>After supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and gave them a full account of her visit.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a splendid time,&rdquo; she concluded happily, &ldquo;and I feel that it marks an epoch in my life.
