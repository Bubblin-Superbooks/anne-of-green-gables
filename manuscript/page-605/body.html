<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Anne. That is fast dye if ever there was any. Your hair must be cut off; there is no other way. You can&rsquo;t go out with it looking like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne&rsquo;s lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla&rsquo;s remarks. With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.</p><p>&ldquo;Please cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over. Oh, I feel that my heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction. The girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed, and I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much. But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you&rsquo;ve dyed it a dreadful color, is there? I&rsquo;m going to weep all the time you&rsquo;re cutting it off, if it won&rsquo;t interfere. It seems such a tragic thing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
