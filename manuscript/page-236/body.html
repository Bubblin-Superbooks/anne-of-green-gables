<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so many. I don&rsquo;t think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were lots I wanted to ask her, but I didn&rsquo;t like to because I didn&rsquo;t think she was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn&rsquo;t, but I could recite, &lsquo;The Dog at His Master&rsquo;s Grave&rsquo; if she liked. That&rsquo;s in the Third Royal Reader. It isn&rsquo;t a really truly religious piece of poetry, but it&rsquo;s so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it wouldn&rsquo;t do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it&rsquo;s splendid. There are two lines in particular that just thrill me.</p></div> </div>
