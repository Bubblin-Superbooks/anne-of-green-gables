<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;m glad because I love driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I&rsquo;m going to live with you and belong to you. I&rsquo;ve never belonged to anybody&mdash;not really. But the asylum was the worst. I&rsquo;ve only been in it four months, but that was enough. I don&rsquo;t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can&rsquo;t possibly understand what it is like. It&rsquo;s worse than anything you could imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I didn&rsquo;t mean to be wicked. It&rsquo;s so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn&rsquo;t it? They were good, you know&mdash;the asylum people. But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum&mdash;only just in the other orphans.</p></div> </div>
