They won&rsquo;t be more than well gathered yet and it&rsquo;ll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham. I&rsquo;ll fill a basket for you. There&rsquo;s plenty of stuff baked in the house. And I&rsquo;ll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, flying to the washstand. &ldquo;Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I&rsquo;d never been born and now I wouldn&rsquo;t change places with an angel!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
