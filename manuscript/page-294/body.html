<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked her.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, you do beat all! But I was wrong&mdash;I see that now. I shouldn&rsquo;t have doubted your word when I&rsquo;d never known you to tell a story. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t right for you to confess to a thing you hadn&rsquo;t done&mdash;it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you&rsquo;ll forgive me, Anne, I&rsquo;ll forgive you and we&rsquo;ll start square again. And now get yourself ready for the picnic.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne flew up like a rocket.</p></div> </div>
