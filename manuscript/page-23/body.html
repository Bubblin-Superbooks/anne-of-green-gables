<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There&rsquo;s never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he&rsquo;s up and off to the lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy. But I said &lsquo;no&rsquo; flat to that. &lsquo;They may be all right&mdash;I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not&mdash;but no London street Arabs for me,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Give me a native born at least. There&rsquo;ll be a risk, no matter who we get. But I&rsquo;ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.&rsquo; So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer&rsquo;s folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven.</p></div> </div>
