<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Come down to your dinner, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner, Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne, sobbingly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t eat anything. My heart is broken. You&rsquo;ll feel remorse of conscience someday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember when the time comes that I forgive you. But please don&rsquo;t ask me to eat anything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction.&rdquo;</p><p>Exasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.</p></div> </div>
