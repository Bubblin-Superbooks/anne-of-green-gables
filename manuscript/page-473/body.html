<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one can&rsquo;t feel quite in the depths of despair with two months&rsquo; vacation before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldn&rsquo;t help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the minister&rsquo;s wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably. Our new minister&rsquo;s wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.</p></div> </div>
