Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the only thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the asylum? I suppose they&rsquo;ll take her back, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it will be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here yesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she&rsquo;d sent by me for a little girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know, and she finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I call it positively providential.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
