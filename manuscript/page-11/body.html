<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s all-seeing eye.</p><p>She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. Thomas Lynde&mdash;a meek little man whom Avonlea people called &ldquo;Rachel Lynde&rsquo;s husband&rdquo;&mdash;was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables.</p></div> </div>
