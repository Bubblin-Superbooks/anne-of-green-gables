How on earth did you get there?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p><p>Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe&rsquo;s hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious, in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!</p><p>&ldquo;What has happened, Anne?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, taking up his oars. &ldquo;We were playing Elaine&rdquo; explained Anne frigidly, without even looking at her rescuer, &ldquo;and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge&mdash;I mean the flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile. The girls went for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
