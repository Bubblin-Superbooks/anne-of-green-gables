Such absurdity!&rdquo; said Marilla.</p><p>Anne sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven&rsquo;t. I just felt that I couldn&rsquo;t bear Josie Pye&rsquo;s scorn. She would have crowed over me all my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn&rsquo;t be very cross with me, Marilla. It&rsquo;s not a bit nice to faint, after all. And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won&rsquo;t be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I&rsquo;ll miss the new lady teacher. She won&rsquo;t be new any more by the time I&rsquo;m able to go to school. And Gil&mdash;everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted mortal. But I&rsquo;ll try to bear it all bravely if only you won&rsquo;t be cross with me, Marilla.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
