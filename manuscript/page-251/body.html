At the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?&rdquo; asked Marilla as they went up through the garden of Green Gables.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on Marilla&rsquo;s part. &ldquo;Oh Marilla, I&rsquo;m the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very moment. I assure you I&rsquo;ll say my prayers with a right good-will tonight. Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr. William Bell&rsquo;s birch grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed? Diana&rsquo;s birthday is in February and mine is in March.</p></div> </div>
