Oh, and I know she will be furious. It&rsquo;s dreadful&mdash;it&rsquo;s really dreadful&mdash;but did you ever know anything so funny, Anne?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is your Aunt Josephine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s aunt and she lives in Charlottetown. She&rsquo;s awfully old&mdash;seventy anyhow&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t believe she was ever a little girl. We were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. She&rsquo;s awfully prim and proper and she&rsquo;ll scold dreadfully about this, I know. Well, we&rsquo;ll have to sleep with Minnie May&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t think how she kicks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
