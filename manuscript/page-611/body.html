It&rsquo;s fun then. But to lie down and pretend I was dead&mdash;I just couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d die really of fright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it would be romantic,&rdquo; conceded Jane Andrews, &ldquo;but I know I couldn&rsquo;t keep still. I&rsquo;d be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I wasn&rsquo;t drifting too far out. And you know, Anne, that would spoil the effect.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
