<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I wouldn&rsquo;t sooner have had happen,&rdquo; thought Marilla, as she nervously shelled the peas. &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that. She&rsquo;s just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that&rsquo;s clear, for there hasn&rsquo;t been a soul in that room since she was in it, by her own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there&rsquo;s nothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she&rsquo;ll be punished. It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods. It&rsquo;s a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It&rsquo;s a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can&rsquo;t trust. Slyness and untruthfulness&mdash;that&rsquo;s what she has displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch. If she&rsquo;d only have told the truth about it I wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
