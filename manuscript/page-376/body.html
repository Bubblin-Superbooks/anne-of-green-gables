I&rsquo;m really worse off than ever before, for I haven&rsquo;t Katie Maurice and Violetta now. And even if I had it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same. Somehow, little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend. Diana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring. It will be sacred in my memory forever. I used the most pathetic language I could think of and said &lsquo;thou&rsquo; and &lsquo;thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou&rsquo; and &lsquo;thee&rsquo; seem so much more romantic than &lsquo;you.&rsquo; Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I&rsquo;m going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life. Please see that it is buried with me, for I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll live very long.</p></div> </div>
