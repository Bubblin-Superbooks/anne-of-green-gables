I&rsquo;m not going to take the scholarship. I decided so the night after you came home from town. You surely don&rsquo;t think I could leave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you&rsquo;ve done for me. I&rsquo;ve been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry wants to rent the farm for next year. So you won&rsquo;t have any bother over that. And I&rsquo;m going to teach. I&rsquo;ve applied for the school here&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to Gilbert Blythe.</p></div> </div>
