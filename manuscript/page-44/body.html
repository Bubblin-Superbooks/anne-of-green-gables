<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, a bride, of course&mdash;a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil. I&rsquo;ve never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don&rsquo;t ever expect to be a bride myself. I&rsquo;m so homely nobody will ever want to marry me&mdash;unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign missionary mightn&rsquo;t be very particular. But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I just love pretty clothes. And I&rsquo;ve never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember&mdash;but of course it&rsquo;s all the more to look forward to, isn&rsquo;t it? And then I can imagine that I&rsquo;m dressed gorgeously. This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know.</p></div> </div>
