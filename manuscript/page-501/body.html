Do learn to take things calmly, child.&rdquo;</p><p>For Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All &ldquo;spirit and fire and dew,&rdquo; as she was, the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill Anne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows.</p></div> </div>
