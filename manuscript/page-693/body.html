<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This message frightened Marilla wholesomely. She read Anne&rsquo;s death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. As a result, Anne had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went. She walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart&rsquo;s content; and when September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel just like studying with might and main,&rdquo; she declared as she brought her books down from the attic. &ldquo;Oh, you good old friends, I&rsquo;m glad to see your honest faces once more&mdash;yes, even you, geometry. I&rsquo;ve had a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I&rsquo;m rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday.</p></div> </div>
