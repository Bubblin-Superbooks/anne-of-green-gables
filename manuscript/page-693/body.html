<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we&rsquo;ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher. But I don&rsquo;t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Marilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have him. If I were a man I think I&rsquo;d be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers&rsquo; hearts. Why can&rsquo;t women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn&rsquo;t got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would.</p></div> </div>
