It doesn&rsquo;t taste a bit like hers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think Marilla&rsquo;s raspberry cordial would prob&rsquo;ly be much nicer than Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Anne loyally. &ldquo;Marilla is a famous cook. She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work. There&rsquo;s so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life;</p></div> </div>
