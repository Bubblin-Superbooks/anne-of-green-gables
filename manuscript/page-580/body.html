<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she&rsquo;d likely be an authority on the subject, having so many sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, &lsquo;What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?&rsquo; And Susan said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;let me see&rsquo;&mdash;and there they were, engaged as quick as that. But I didn&rsquo;t think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could. I made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees, although Ruby Gillis says it isn&rsquo;t done nowadays.</p></div> </div>
