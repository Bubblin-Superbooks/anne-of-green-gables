<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again. If there wasn&rsquo;t a brook I&rsquo;d be haunted by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one. I&rsquo;m not in the depths of despair this morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn&rsquo;t it a splendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I&rsquo;ve just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted. But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
