<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you&rsquo;re beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It&rsquo;s a serious thing to grow up, isn&rsquo;t it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as you and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up successfully, and I&rsquo;m sure it will be my own fault if I don&rsquo;t. I feel it&rsquo;s a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I don&rsquo;t grow up right I can&rsquo;t go back and begin over again. I&rsquo;ve grown two inches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby&rsquo;s party. I&rsquo;m so glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce.</p></div> </div>
