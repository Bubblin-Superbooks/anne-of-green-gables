I can&rsquo;t tell you the person&rsquo;s name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets and wreaths, singing &lsquo;My Home on the Hill.&rsquo; Oh, it was so thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane&rsquo;s folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a real sensation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much wonder! Such silly doings!&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s response.</p></div> </div>
