<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh, we have named that little round pool over in Mr. Barry&rsquo;s field Willowmere. I got that name out of the book Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine had five lovers. I&rsquo;d be satisfied with one, wouldn&rsquo;t you? She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as easy as anything. I&rsquo;d love to be able to faint, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Marilla? It&rsquo;s so romantic. But I&rsquo;m really very healthy for all I&rsquo;m so thin. I believe I&rsquo;m getting fatter, though. Don&rsquo;t you think I am? I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming. Diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to wear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I don&rsquo;t feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic.</p></div> </div>
