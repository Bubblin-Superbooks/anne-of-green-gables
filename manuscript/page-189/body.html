How dare you say I&rsquo;m freckled and redheaded? You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling woman!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne!&rdquo; exclaimed Marilla in consternation.</p><p>But Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes blazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like an atmosphere.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you say such things about me?&rdquo; she repeated vehemently. &ldquo;How would you like to have such things said about you? How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn&rsquo;t a spark of imagination in you? I don&rsquo;t care if I do hurt your feelings by saying so!
