<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I don&rsquo;t like to have them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don&rsquo;t want to use big words any more. It&rsquo;s almost a pity, isn&rsquo;t it, now that I&rsquo;m really growing big enough to say them if I did want to. It&rsquo;s fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla. There&rsquo;s so much to learn and do and think that there isn&rsquo;t time for big words. Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and better. She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was hard at first. I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of&mdash;and I thought of any number of them. But I&rsquo;ve got used to it now and I see it&rsquo;s so much better.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
