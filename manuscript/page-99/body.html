<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are interesting, don&rsquo;t you think? You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen through the day, and there&rsquo;s so much scope for imagination. But I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s not rainy today because it&rsquo;s easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal to bear up under. It&rsquo;s all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but it&rsquo;s not so nice when you really come to have them, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;You talk entirely too much for a little girl.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
