She couldn&rsquo;t be left there, no matter where the mistake had come in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this is a pretty piece of business!&rdquo; ejaculated Marilla.</p><p>During this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from one to the other, all the animation fading out of her face.

I&rsquo;m going to burst into tears!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
