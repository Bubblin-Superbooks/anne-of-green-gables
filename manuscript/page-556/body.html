There&rsquo;s enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare there is. You&rsquo;ll just pamper Anne&rsquo;s vanity, Matthew, and she&rsquo;s as vain as a peacock now.

The puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they&rsquo;re as big as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways.&rdquo;</p><p>Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world.
