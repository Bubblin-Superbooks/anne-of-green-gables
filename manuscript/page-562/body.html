First a card with &ldquo;For the Anne-girl and Merry Christmas,&rdquo; written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;Diana, this is too much. I must be dreaming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I call it providential,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to borrow Ruby&rsquo;s slippers now, and that&rsquo;s a blessing, for they&rsquo;re two sizes too big for you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie Pye would be delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the practice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal to that?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
