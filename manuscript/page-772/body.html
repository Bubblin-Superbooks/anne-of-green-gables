<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You shouldn&rsquo;t cry, Anne; it isn&rsquo;t becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem all red. I&rsquo;d a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable around, Anne? I&rsquo;m literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla &lsquo;d load you up with cake. That&rsquo;s why I called round. Otherwise I&rsquo;d have gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards same place as I do, and he&rsquo;s a sport. He noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you&rsquo;d been before that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
