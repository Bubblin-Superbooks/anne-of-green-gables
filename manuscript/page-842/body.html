<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it. I guess you&rsquo;re going to teach right here in Avonlea. The trustees have decided to give you the school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lynde!&rdquo; cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. &ldquo;Why, I thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he went to them&mdash;they had a business meeting at the school last night, you know&mdash;and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested that they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that&rsquo;s what. Real self-sacrificing, too, for he&rsquo;ll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he&rsquo;s got to earn his own way through college.</p></div> </div>
