I pity the people who aren&rsquo;t born yet for missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can never have this one. And it&rsquo;s splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty and hot,&rdquo; said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have.</p></div> </div>
