I&rsquo;m in the depths of despair and I don&rsquo;t care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more. Little things like that are of no importance now because I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll ever be able to go anywhere again. My career is closed. Please, Marilla, go away and don&rsquo;t look at me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
