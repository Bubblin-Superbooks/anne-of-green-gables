Yes, that is the right name for it. I know because of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?&rdquo;</p><p>Matthew ruminated.</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you think it can? There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it Barry&rsquo;s pond?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
