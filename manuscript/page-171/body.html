<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she&rsquo;s about your age. She&rsquo;s a very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she comes home. She&rsquo;s visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You&rsquo;ll have to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a very particular woman. She won&rsquo;t let Diana play with any little girl who isn&rsquo;t nice and good.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with interest.</p><p>&ldquo;What is Diana like? Her hair isn&rsquo;t red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It&rsquo;s bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn&rsquo;t endure it in a bosom friend.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
