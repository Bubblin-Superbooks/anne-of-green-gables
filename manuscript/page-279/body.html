A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result.

Matthew was confounded and puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he had to admit that circumstances were against her.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it hasn&rsquo;t fell down behind the bureau?&rdquo; was the only suggestion he could offer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve moved the bureau and I&rsquo;ve taken out the drawers and I&rsquo;ve looked in every crack and cranny&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s positive answer. &ldquo;The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it.</p></div> </div>
