She&rsquo;s feeling real worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she got up this morning&mdash;and Josephine Barry&rsquo;s temper is no joke, I can tell you that. She wouldn&rsquo;t speak to Diana at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Diana&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; said Anne contritely. &ldquo;It was mine. I suggested racing to see who would get into bed first.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
