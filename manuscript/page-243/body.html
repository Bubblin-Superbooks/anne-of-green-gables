<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get into a fluster. And I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t use such long words. It sounds so funny in a little girl. I guess Diana &lsquo;ll like you well enough. It&rsquo;s her mother you&rsquo;ve got to reckon with. If she doesn&rsquo;t like you it won&rsquo;t matter how much Diana does. If she has heard about your outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll think of you. You must be polite and well behaved, and don&rsquo;t make any of your startling speeches. For pity&rsquo;s sake, if the child isn&rsquo;t actually trembling!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
