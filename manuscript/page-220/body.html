<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How can I be vain when I know I&rsquo;m homely?&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;I love pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that isn&rsquo;t pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful&mdash;just as I feel when I look at any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn&rsquo;t beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Handsome is as handsome does,&rdquo; quoted Marilla. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had that said to me before, but I have my doubts about it,&rdquo; remarked skeptical Anne, sniffing at her narcissi. &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t these flowers sweet! It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs. Lynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven, doesn&rsquo;t it? Aren&rsquo;t the stars bright tonight? If you could live in a star, which one would you pick? I&rsquo;d like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
