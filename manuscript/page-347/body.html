<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes. Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father&rsquo;s crop is good too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is fairly good, thank you. Have you picked many of your apples yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, ever so many,&rdquo; said Anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings, Diana. Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree. Marilla is a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea. But it isn&rsquo;t good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat, so I won&rsquo;t tell you what she said we could have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it&rsquo;s bright red color. I love bright red drinks, don&rsquo;t you? They taste twice as good as any other color.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
