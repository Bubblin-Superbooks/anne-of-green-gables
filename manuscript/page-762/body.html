<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer ways. You&rsquo;ve grown up now and you&rsquo;re going away; and you look so tall and stylish and so&mdash;so&mdash;different altogether in that dress&mdash;as if you didn&rsquo;t belong in Avonlea at all&mdash;and I just got lonesome thinking it all over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marilla!&rdquo; Anne sat down on Marilla&rsquo;s gingham lap, took Marilla&rsquo;s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit changed&mdash;not really. I&rsquo;m only just pruned down and branched out. The real me&mdash;back here&mdash;is just the same. It won&rsquo;t make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly;</p></div> </div>
