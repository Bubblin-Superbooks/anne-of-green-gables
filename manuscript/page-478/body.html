<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man, but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustn&rsquo;t you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive; but Mrs. Lynde says he isn&rsquo;t married, or even engaged, because she made special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn&rsquo;t she, Matthew? I&rsquo;m very glad they&rsquo;ve called Mr. Allan. I liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.</p></div> </div>
