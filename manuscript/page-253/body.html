<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Don&rsquo;t you think that is a very strange coincidence? Diana is going to lend me a book to read. She says it&rsquo;s perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting. She&rsquo;s going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow. Don&rsquo;t you think Diana has got very soulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes. Diana is going to teach me to sing a song called &lsquo;Nelly in the Hazel Dell.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s going to give me a picture to put up in my room; it&rsquo;s a perfectly beautiful picture, she says&mdash;a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent gave it to her. I wish I had something to give Diana. I&rsquo;m an inch taller than Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she&rsquo;d like to be thin because it&rsquo;s so much more graceful, but I&rsquo;m afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings. We&rsquo;re going to the shore some day to gather shells.</p></div> </div>
