<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, good evening, Marilla. I hope you&rsquo;ll come down to see me often as usual. But you can&rsquo;t expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if I&rsquo;m liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It&rsquo;s something new in my experience.&rdquo;</p><p>Whereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away&mdash;if a fat woman who always waddled could be said to sweep away&mdash;and Marilla with a very solemn face betook herself to the east gable.</p><p>On the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do. She felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted. How unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs. Rachel Lynde, of all people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in Anne&rsquo;s disposition.</p></div> </div>
