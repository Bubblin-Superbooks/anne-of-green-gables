<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to Green Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is a new word I learned today. I heard Mary Alice Bell use it. Isn&rsquo;t it very expressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters&mdash;six of us at a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn&rsquo;t caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she&rsquo;d fallen in and prob&rsquo;ly been drowned. I wish it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Marilla, I assure you it was sublime.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
