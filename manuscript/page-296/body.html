<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her stocking basket.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to own up that I made a mistake,&rdquo; she concluded candidly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think of Anne&rsquo;s &lsquo;confession,&rsquo; although I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t for it really was a falsehood. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem as bad as the other would have been, somehow, and anyhow I&rsquo;m responsible for it. That child is hard to understand in some respects. But I believe she&rsquo;ll turn out all right yet. And there&rsquo;s one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that she&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
