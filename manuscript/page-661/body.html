She sometimes thought wistfully that Marilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding. But she always checked the thought reproachfully, remembering what she owed to Marilla.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla abruptly, &ldquo;Miss Stacy was here this afternoon when you were out with Diana.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne came back from her other world with a start and a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Was she? Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry I wasn&rsquo;t in. Why didn&rsquo;t you call me, Marilla? Diana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It&rsquo;s lovely in the woods now.
